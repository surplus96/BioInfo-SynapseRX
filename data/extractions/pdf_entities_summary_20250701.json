Introduction\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and a leading\ncause of cancer-related mortality [1,2]. The Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n(KRAS) gene, a member of the RAS family, encodes a small GTPase protein that acts as a\ncritical molecular switch in cellular signaling pathways regulating proliferation, differenti-\nation, and survival [3,4]. Mutations in KRAS occur in approximately 40% of CRC cases,\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17091512\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n2 of 20\nwith the most frequent alterations found in codons 12, 13, and 61 [3,5,6]. These mutations\nresult in the constitutive activation of KRAS, leading to unregulated downstream signaling\nthrough pathways such as RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR, which\ndrive tumorigenesis [4,7]. Clinically, KRAS mutations are associated with poor prognosis,\nresistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (like cetuximab and panitumumab), and\nlimited therapeutic options, making this a challenging subset of CRC to treat [3,6,8].\nDespite the historically “undruggable” nature of KRAS, recent advances in molecu-\nlar biology and targeted drug development have sparked new hope for addressing this\nmutation. The approval of KRAS G12C inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, has\ndemonstrated that the direct targeting of mutant KRAS is feasible. Beyond small-molecule\ninhibitors, novel therapeutic strategies are emerging, including immunotherapy (e.g.,\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), KRAS neoantigen vaccines, and adoptive T-cell thera-\npies), RNA interference (RNAi) to silence mutant KRAS expression, and CRISPR-based\ngene editing to correct or disrupt oncogenic KRAS alleles [9–16]. Additionally, nanoparticle\ndelivery systems are being explored to enhance drug bioavailability and tumor-specific\ntargeting while minimizing off-target effects [17,18]. Among these approaches, small-\nmolecule inhibitors remain particularly advantageous because of their high efficacy rates\nin blocking KRAS signaling, oral bioavailability, and relatively lower production costs com-\npared to those of biologics or cell-based therapies. Their well-established pharmacokinetic\nprofiles and ease of combination with existing regimens further underscore their clinical\nutility [19,20].\nThis review aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying KRAS-mutant\nCRC, recent progress in understanding its biology, and emerging therapeutic strategies. By\nhighlighting cutting-edge research and clinical advancements, this article seeks to provide\na comprehensive update on this critical topic in oncology.\n2. Molecular Biology of KRAS Mutations\nThe KRAS gene, located on chromosome 12p12.1, encodes a small GTPase that func-\ntions as a molecular switch in key cellular signaling pathways (Figure 1) [4,5]. Under\nnormal physiological conditions, KRAS cycles between an active, GTP-bound state and\nan inactive, GDP-bound state. This cycling is tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide ex-\nchange factors (GEFs), such as SOS1, which promote GTP binding, and GTPase-activating\nproteins (GAPs), such as NF1, which accelerate GTP hydrolysis [7,21,22]. In its active\nstate, KRAS interacts with downstream effectors, including RAF kinases, phosphoinositide\n3-kinase (PI3K), and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), to regulate cellular\nprocesses, such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival [4,22,23].\nIn CRC, mutations in KRAS are among the earliest genetic events [24] and impair\nthe intrinsic GTPase activity of KRAS, rendering it as constitutively active. This leads\nto the persistent activation of downstream signaling pathways, even in the absence of\nupstream growth factor stimuli [25,26]. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway is a\nprimary effector of KRAS signaling, promoting uncontrolled cellular proliferation and\nsurvival [27,28]. Simultaneously, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is activated, contributing\nto metabolic reprogramming, resistance to apoptosis, and enhanced tumor growth [29,30].\nThe oncogenic potential of KRAS mutations is further amplified by crosstalk with other sig-\nnaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)\npathways [31–33]. KRAS mutations also induce alterations in cellular metabolism, favoring\nglycolysis and glutaminolysis to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands of rapidly\nproliferating tumor cells [34–36]. Furthermore, mutant KRAS contributes to genomic in-\nstability by promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and impairing DNA\nrepair mechanisms [37,38]. These molecular and cellular alterations not only drive tumor\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n3 of 20\ninitiation and progression but also create a tumor microenvironment (TME) conducive\nto immune evasion and resistance to therapy [36,37]. Thus, understanding the molecular\nbiology of KRAS is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies.\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of the KRAS-signaling pathway and therapeutic targeting strategies\nin metastatic colorectal cancer. Contemporary approaches to KRAS-targeted therapy encompass\nboth direct and indirect strategies aimed at suppressing RAS activation and downstream effector\npathways, notably the MAPK and PI3K cascades. Direct inhibition includes mutation-specific agents,\nsuch as KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D inhibitors, as well as RAS(ON) inhibitors and other novel\ncompounds currently under development. Indirect strategies involve targeting upstream modulators\nof KRAS activation, including SHP2 and SOS1 inhibitors, which interfere with the guanine nucleotide\nexchange process necessary for the transition from the inactive GDP-bound KRAS state to the active\nGTP-bound conformation. In parallel, the pharmacological inhibition of downstream effectors,\nparticularly RAF and MEK, is also under active investigation.\nKRAS mutations most commonly occur in codons 12, 13, and 61, with G12D, G12V, and\nG13D being the most frequently observed in CRC [39,40]. The functional impact of KRAS\nmutations in CRC depends on the specific amino acid substitution, as different mutations\nresult in distinct biochemical and signaling alterations that influence tumor behaviors and\ntherapeutic responses [40]. For example, G12D mutations predominantly activate the PI3K\npathway, contributing to enhanced survival signaling, while G12V mutations are more\ndependent on the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade, promoting aggressive tumor growth [40,41].\nUnlike other KRAS mutations, which are generally resistant to anti-EGFR therapies, G13D\nmutations retain some sensitivity because of impaired binding to NF1 [42,43]. These\nfunctional differences influence prognoses, metastatic potentials, and responses to tar-\ngeted therapies. Understanding the unique properties of KRAS mutations is crucial for\ndeveloping tailored therapeutic strategies.\n3. Biological Implications of KRAS Mutations\n3.1. Tumor Initiation and Progression\nKRAS mutations play a pivotal role in the multistep progression of colorectal cancer.\nFollowing the inactivation of APC, mutant KRAS drives the transition from the normal\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n4 of 20\ncolonic epithelium to premalignant adenomas by promoting uncontrolled cellular prolifera-\ntion and resistance to apoptosis. The deletion of chromosome 18q and inactivation of TP53\nfurther accelerate tumor progression and promote the transition to malignancy [44–47].\nThe oncogenic effects of KRAS are not limited to cell-autonomous mechanisms but also\ninvolve interactions with the TME, facilitating angiogenesis and immune evasion [36].\n3.2. Impact on the TME\nKRAS mutations significantly remodel the TME, creating conditions that support\ntumor growth and metastasis. KRAS-driven tumors secrete vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF), promoting angiogenesis and enhancing nutrient and oxygen delivery to\nthe tumor [48,49]. Mutant KRAS upregulates the production of cytokines and chemokines,\nsuch as IL-6, CXCL8, and TGF-β, which recruit regulatory T-cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the TME. These\nimmune cells suppress antitumor immunity and enable immune evasion [7,26,48,50]. Ad-\nditionally, KRAS mutations upregulate programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression\non tumor cells, inhibiting T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity [26]. These changes collectively\nfoster an immunosuppressive TME that is permissive to tumor progression and resistant to\ntherapy.\n3.3. Role in Metastasis\nKRAS mutations are strongly associated with the metastatic potential of CRC. Mutant\nKRAS promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process characterized by the\nloss of epithelial cellular adhesion and increased cellular motility, and suppresses immune\nsurveillance to allow circulating tumor cells to colonize distant sites. This enables cancer\ncells to invade surrounding tissues and disseminate to distant organs [51–53].\n3.4. Therapeutic Resistance\nOne of the most clinically significant implications of KRAS mutations in CRC is their\nassociation with therapeutic resistance. KRAS mutations confer primary resistance to anti-\nEGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, which are effective\nonly in RAS wild-type tumors. This resistance arises because mutant KRAS drives down-\nstream signaling independent of upstream EGFR activation, rendering EGFR inhibition as\nineffective [30,54,55]. KRAS mutations also contribute to resistance to chemotherapy and\nradiotherapy. For example, mutant KRAS alters the apoptotic machinery, making tumor\ncells less susceptible to DNA damage induced by cytotoxic agents [30]. Similarly, KRAS-\ndriven metabolic reprogramming enhances the survival of cancer cells under therapeutic\nstress [35,56,57].\nIn summary, the biological implications of KRAS mutations in CRC are multifaceted,\nencompassing tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, immune evasion, and treatment\nresistance. These insights into the molecular and cellular effects of KRAS mutations provide\na foundation for developing innovative therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for\npatients with KRAS-mutant CRC.\n4. Advances in Therapeutics\n4.1. KRAS G12C Inhibitors\nKRAS G12C mutations occur in approximately 3–4% of CRCs [58,59]. Recent advance-\nments in targeted therapy have led to the development of small-molecule, covalent KRAS\nG12C inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, which selectively and irreversibly bind\nto the mutant KRAS G12C protein, locking it in an inactive GDP-bound state and turning\noff its oncogenic signaling.\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n5 of 20\nThe phase 1 CodeBreaK 100 trial evaluated oral sotorasib (AMG 510) in 129 patients\nwith advanced solid tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation. A total of 56.6% had\ntreatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade, and 11.6% had grade 3 or 4 TRAEs.\nA total of forty-two patients had CRC and had previously received at least two lines of\nsystemic therapy. The study observed an objective response rate (ORR) of 7.1% (three\npatients with a confirmed partial response (PR)) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 73.8%\n(thirty-one patients) in the CRC subgroup. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was\n4.0 months (range: 0.0–11.1+) among the CRC patients [60]. In the single-arm, phase 2 CRC\ncohort of the CodeBreaK 100 trial, 62 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced CRC,\nwhose disease had progressed after fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, were\nenrolled and received sotorasib monotherapy (960 mg once daily). Six patients achieved a\npartial response, with an ORR of 9.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6–19.9) and median\nduration of response (DOR) of 4.2 months (interquartile range (IQR): 2.9–8.5). The DCR\nwas 82.5% (95% CI: 70.5–90.8). The median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 4.0 months\n(95% CI: 2.8–4.2) and 10.6 months (95% CI: 7.7–15.6), respectively. TRAEs of any grade\noccurred in 55% of the patients, most commonly diarrhea (21%) and nausea (16%). A total\nof 10% developed grade 3 TRAEs, including diarrhea (3%), and 2% had grade 4 TRAEs,\nwith elevated blood creatinine phosphokinase [61].\nAdagrasib (MRTX849) was investigated in a phase 1/2 KRYSTAL-1 trial [62,63]. A\ntotal of 44 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) harboring mutant\nKRAS G12C received adagrasib monotherapy (600 mg orally, twice daily). The ORR was\n19% (95% CI: 8–33), with a median DOR of 4.3 months (95% CI: 2.3–8.3). The median PFS\nand OS were 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.1–8.3) and 19.8 months (95% CI: 12.5–23.0), respectively.\nTRAEs of any grade occurred in 93% of the patients, most commonly diarrhea (66%), nausea\n(57%), vomiting (45%), and fatigue (45%). A total of 34% of the patients developed grade 3\nor 4 TRAEs, including anemia (9%) and diarrhea (7%) [63].\nDivarasib (GDC-6036) is a second-generation, covalent KRAS G12C inhibitor that\nselectively and irreversibly locks the protein in its inactive state. It has been shown to be\n5–20 times as potent and up to 50 times as selective compared to sotorasib and adagrasib,\nas per in vitro studies [64,65]. In a phase 1 study, divarasib (50–400 mg orally, once daily)\nwas evaluated in 137 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring the\nKRAS G12C mutation. TRAEs occurred in 93% of the patients, most commonly nausea\n(74%), diarrhea (61%), and vomiting (58%). Grade 3 events occurred in 11% of the patients\nand included diarrhea (4%), an increase in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (3%),\nand an increase in the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (3%). A grade 4 TRAE (an\nanaphylactic reaction) occurred in one patient (1%). Among the 55 patients with CRC,\na confirmed response was observed in 29.1% of the patients (95% CI: 17.6–42.9), with a\nmedian DOR of 7.1 months (95% CI: 5.5–7.8). The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI:\n4.1–8.2). Of the 39 patients who received divarasib at 400 mg, the confirmed ORR was\n35.9% (95% CI: 21.2–52.8), with a median DOR of 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.7 to could not\nbe estimated). The median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.3–9.1) [64]. The study also\ndemonstrated that the rapid and deep decline in the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)\nfraction was associated with the treatment response and PFS [66].\nOlomorasib (LY3537982) is another potent and highly selective second-generation\nKRAS G12C inhibitor. It achieves a high target occupancy rate at a very low-dose expo-\nsure [67,68]. The phase 1/2 LOXO-RAS-20001 study (NCT04956640) is evaluating olo-\nmorasib in patients with KRAS-G12C-mutant advanced solid tumors. The updated results\nshowed that, among the 157 patients who received olomorasib monotherapy (50–200 mg\norally, twice daily), TRAEs of any grade occurred in 62% of the patients, most commonly\ndiarrhea (24%), fatigue (10%), and nausea (10%). A total of 5% had grade ≥3 TRAEs. Of\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n6 of 20\nthe 32 patients with CRC, the ORR was 9% (3 PR), and the DCR was 84%. The mPFS was 4\nmonths (95% CI: 3–7). Olomorasib also demonstrated efficacy in patients with non-small\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had prior exposure to a KRAS G12C inhibitor [67].\n4.2. KRAS G12C Inhibitors Combined with Anti-EGFR Therapy\nAlthough KRAS G12C inhibitors have shown promise in early-phase clinical trials,\nstudies like KRYSTAL-1 and CodeBreaK 100 have highlighted modest response rates,\nemphasizing the need for combination strategies. Although KRAS G12C inhibitors suppress\nthe mutant KRAS protein, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK, primarily EGFR in CRC)-\nmediated upstream feedback reactivation of the RAS-MAPK-signaling pathway may occur\nin a KRAS-G12C-independent manner, resulting in treatment resistance [69,70]. Preclinical\ndata have suggested that the combinatorial targeting of EGFR and KRAS G12C leverages a\ndual-pathway blockade to inhibit tumor growth more effectively and may overcome the\nadaptive resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition [70].\nCodeBreaK 101 (NCT04185883) is an ongoing phase 1 trial exploring sotorasib\nmonotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, including anti-EGFR\nagents (panitumumab), MEK inhibitors, and ICIs, in advanced solid tumors harboring the\nKRAS G12C mutation. The combination of sotorasib (960 mg once daily) and panitumumab\nwas evaluated in patients with chemotherapy–refractory KRAS-G12C-mutant mCRC. A\ntotal of 40 patients were enrolled in the dose-expansion cohort. The confirmed ORR was\n30.0% (95% CI: 16.6–46.5). The median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.2–7.7). The median\nOS was 15.2 months (95% CI: 12.5–not estimable (NE)) [71]. The phase 3 CodeBreaK 300\ntrial randomized 160 patients with KRAS-G12C-mutant, chemotherapy–refractory mCRC\nto receive sotorasib (960 mg) plus panitumumab, sotorasib (240 mg) plus panitumumab,\nor the investigator’s choice of trifluridine–tipiracil or regorafenib (the standard of care\n(SOC)). The primary endpoint was PFS, and the trial was not powered to detect a differ-\nence in OS because of the low prevalence of the KRAS G12C mutation in metastatic CRC.\nGrade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 35.8%, 30.2%, and 43.1% of the patients, respectively. Skin-\nrelated toxicity and hypomagnesemia were the most common adverse events observed with\nsotorasib–panitumumab. The median PFSs were 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.2–6.3; hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.49; p = 0.006, vs. SOC), 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.7–5.8; HR 0.58; p = 0.03, vs. SOC), and\n2.2 months (95% CI: 1.9–3.9), respectively [72]. With a median follow-up of 13.6 months, the\nmedian OS was not reached (HR 0.70; p = 0.20, vs. SOC) vs. 11.9 months (95% CI: 7.5-NE;\nHR 0.83; p = 0.50, vs. SOC) vs. 10.3 months (95% CI: 7.0-NE). The ORRs were 30.2% (95% CI:\n18.3–44.3), 7.5% (95% CI: 2.1–18.2), and 1.9% (95% CI: 0.0–9.9), respectively [73]. On January\n16, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sotorasib (recommended\ndosage: 960 mg) with panitumumab for adult patients with KRAS-G12C-mutant mCRC,\nwho had received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemothera-\npies. The phase 3 CodeBreaK 301 trial is comparing sotorasib + panitumumab + FOLFIRI\nversus FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab in the first-line setting [74].\nThe combination of adagrasib (600 mg twice daily) and cetuximab was also evaluated\nin the phase1/2 KRYSTAL-1 trial, with the primary endpoint of the ORR. A total of\n94 patients received the combination therapy. A total of 16% developed grade 3–4 TRAEs.\nAmong the 28 evaluable patients, the ORR was 34.0%, the DCR was 85.1%, and the median\nDOR was 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.2–7.6). The median PFS and OS were 6.9 months (95% CI:\n5.7–7.4) and 15.9 months (95% CI: 11.8–18.8), respectively. All the patients developed TRAEs,\nwith grade 3–4 in 27.7% of the patients. Exploratory analyses suggested that ctDNA may be\nassociated with responses and acquired resistance [75]. On 21 June 2024, the FDA granted\naccelerated approval to adagrasib plus cetuximab for adults with KRAS-G12C-mutant\nlocally advanced or mCRC after prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n7 of 20\nchemotherapies. This combination is being compared with SOC chemotherapy as second-\nline treatment in the ongoing phase 3 KRYSTAL-10 trial [63].\nDivarasib in combination with cetuximab was evaluated in patients with metastatic\nKRAS-G12C-positive CRC (n = 29) in a phase 1 study. All (100.0% of) the patients experi-\nenced at least one TRAE, most commonly rash (96.6%), diarrhea (82.8%), nausea (72.4%),\nand vomiting (48.3%). Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 37.9% of the patients and grade 4 in\n6.9%. The confirmed ORR was 62.5% (95% CI: 40.6–81.2) in KRAS-G12C-inhibitor-naïve\npatients (n = 24), with a median DOR of 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6-NE). The median PFS was\n8.1 months (95% CI: 5.5–12.3) [65].\nIn the combination cohort of the phase 1 study (NCT04956640), 46 patients with\ntreatment-refractory mCRC were treated with olomorasib (100 or 150 mg twice daily) and\ncetuximab. Dermatitis acneiform (59%), diarrhea (44%), dry skin (44%), hypomagnesemia\n(33%), and fatigue (30%) were among the most common treatment-emergent adverse events\n(TEAEs). Among the 38 patients evaluable for efficacy, the ORR was 42% (all the PR), and\nthe DCR was 95% [68].\nThe encouraging efficacy with a manageable toxicity profile supports the further in-\nvestigation of divarasib and olomorasib combined with cetuximab in KRAS-G12C-positive\nCRC. Ongoing clinical trials that investigate KRAS G12C inhibitors and combination thera-\npies in KRAS-G12C-mutant CRC are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1.

Single-agent BRAF inhibitors (e.g., vemurafenib) have shown limited\nefficacy in mCRC because of EGFR-mediated feedback activation [76]. The BEACON CRC\ntrial demonstrated that the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab (with or without\nbinimetinib) provided a survival benefit over that of standard therapy in previously treated\nBRAF-V600E-mutant mCRC [77]. More recently, the phase 3 BREAKWATER study has been\nevaluating encorafenib + cetuximab ± chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) in first-line\nand later-line settings. The early results suggest promising efficacy, with a notable increase\nin the ORR to 60.9% in the triplet therapy arm versus 40.0% with chemotherapy alone\n(odds ratio 2.443; p = 0.0008) in chemotherapy-naïve patients, reinforcing the potential of\nBRAF/EGFR inhibition as a backbone in earlier treatment lines [78]. The findings led to the\nFDA’s accelerated approval of this combination on 20 December 2024, establishing a new\nstandard of care in first-line treatment for BRAF-V600E-mutant mCRC.\n4.3. Targeting Other KRAS Mutations\n4.3.1. KRAS G12D\nUnlike KRAS G12C, KRAS G12D lacks a reactive residue proximal to the switch-II-\nbinding pocket, making a covalent modification challenging [79,80]. The development\nof KRAS-G12D-specific inhibitors utilized different approaches. MRTX1133 is a potent,\nhighly selective, and non-covalent KRAS G12D inhibitor that binds to the GDP-bound,\ninactive form of KRAS G12D and occupies the switch-II pocket. It markedly inhibited\nKRAS-dependent signaling and demonstrated potent antitumor activity both in vitro and\nin vivo [79,81]. A phase 1/2 trial of MRTX1133 in advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS\nG12D is underway.\nHRS-4642 is a high-affinity, selective, non-covalent KRAS G12D inhibitor. It exhibited\nhigh selectivity in inhibiting the growth of KRAS-G12D-mutant cell lines and demonstrated\nrobust efficacy against KRAS-G12D-mutant human pancreatic cancer and CRC models [80].\nThe preliminary results of the first in-human, phase 1 study in patients with advanced\nKRAS-G12D-mutant solid tumors reported a tolerable safety profile. Among the 13 efficacy-\nevaluable patients, 61.1% had stable disease, and 33.3% experienced target lesion shrinkage,\nincluding those with lung cancer and CRC [82].\nLY3962673 is another non-covalent KRAS G12D inhibitor with high affinity for KRAS\nG12D-GDP and demonstrated robust antitumor activity in cancer cell lines and multiple\nKRAS-G12D-mutant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models [83]. RMC-9805 is a first-\nin-class, mutant selective covalent inhibitor of RASG12D(ON), which is the active, GTP-\nbound state (“ON” state) of RASG12D. It disrupts downstream RAS signaling by the steric\nocclusion of effector binding and inhibits cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Combinations\nof RMC-9805 with either RMC-6236 (RASMULTI(ON) inhibitor) or an anti-EGFR antibody\nimproved the depth of the response and delayed the onset of resistance in KRAS G12D CRC\nmodels [84]. These and several other KRAS-G12D-targeted inhibitors are being evaluated in\nearly-phase trials, which enrolled patients with mCRC, as monotherapy and in combination\ntherapy (Table 2).\nProteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that recruit E3\nubiquitin ligases, e.g., VHL or CRBN, to tag oncogenic proteins, like KRAS, for ubiquiti-\nnation and subsequent proteasomal degradation [85,86]. Unlike direct KRAS inhibitors,\nPROTACs achieve complete protein knockdown, potentially overcoming resistance mecha-\nnisms driven by compensatory feedback loops [87]. Early preclinical studies have demon-\nstrated that KRAS-targeting PROTACs, including degraders specific for KRAS G12D and\nKRAS G12V mutants, effectively reduce KRAS protein levels and suppress downstream\nMAPK signaling in various cancer cell lines and xenograft models [88,89]. The preliminary\nresults of a phase 1 trial evaluating a first-in-class, KRAS-G12D-selective protein degrader,\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n9 of 20\nASP3082, in advanced pancreatic cancer, CRC, and NSCLC showed an acceptable safety\nprofile and promising antitumor activity, especially in pretreated pancreatic cancer [90].\nTable 2.

Pan-KRAS Inhibitors\nPan-KRAS inhibitors are a promising area of research for treating KRAS-mutant\nmCRC. QTX3034 is a highly selective, non-covalent, multi-KRAS inhibitor with potent\nactivity across several KRAS variants, including G12D and G12V [91,92]. QTX3034 binds to\nGDP-bound forms of mutant and wild-type KRAS, inhibiting KRAS signaling in vitro and\ninducing tumor regressions in both pancreatic and colorectal KRAS G12D xenograft models.\nA phase 1 trial in KRAS-G12D-mutant tumors is ongoing [92]. RMC-6236 is a non-covalent,\npotent tri-complex inhibitor of mutant and wild-type RAS variants and targets the active,\nGTP-bound state of RAS(ON) [93]. RMC-6236 exhibited robust anticancer efficacy across\nRAS-addicted cell lines and multiple tumor types in KRAS G12X xenograft models [94].\nThese and several other pan-RAS inhibitors are being investigated in KRAS-mutant mCRC\n(Table 2).\n4.4. Targeting KRAS-Signaling Pathways\nKRAS mutations activate downstream signaling cascades, including the MAPK (RAS-\nRAF-MEK-ERK) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, which drive tumor growth and survival.\nNovel therapies targeting these pathways aim to overcome the limitations of monotherapy\nby disrupting resistance mechanisms or amplifying therapeutic effects.\nSOS1 is a GEF that facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP and KRAS activation.\nMRTX0902 is a selective and potent SOS1 inhibitor that disrupts the KRAS:SOS1 protein–\nprotein interaction. MRTX0902 synergized with adagrasib and augmented the antitumor\nactivity in KRAS-G12C-mutant human NSCLC and CRC xenograft models. In KRAS-\nMAPK-pathway-mutant models, the dual inhibition of RTK/MAPK pathway signaling by\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n10 of 20\nMRTX0902 with EGFR or RAF/MEK inhibitors resulted in greater suppression of pathway\nsignaling and better antitumor responses [95]. MRTX0902 alone and with adagrasib are\nbeing evaluated in a phase 1/2 study (Table 1).\nSHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase essential for activating the RAS-MAPK path-\nway downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. The inhibition of SHP2 disrupts KRAS\nsignaling and sensitizes tumors to KRAS inhibitors [96,97]. Trials evaluating SHP2 inhibitor\nmonotherapy and in combination with an KRAS inhibitor are ongoing (Tables 1–3). The\npreliminary result of glecirasib (a KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus JAB-3312 (an SHP2 inhibitor)\ndemonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with KRAS-G12C-mutant tumors,\nincluding 17 CRCs, and a promising ORR and a promising PFS as a front-line treatment for\npatients with KRAS G12C NSCLC [98].\nTable 3.\nSelected clinical trials with other (non-KRAS) targeted therapies in KRAS-mutant\ncolorectal cancer.\nClinical Trial\nPhase\nIntervention\nTarget\nNCT05163028\n1\nHBI-2376\nSHP2\nNCT04121286\n1\nJAB-3312\nSHP2\nNCT05786924\n1\nBDTX-4933\nRAF\nNCT06194877\n1\nBrimarafenib (BGB-3245) + panitumumab\nRAF, EGFR\nNCT05200442\n1/2\nAvutometinib (VS-6766) + cetuximab\nRAF/MEK, EGFR\nNCT06270082\n1\nIK-595\nRAF/MEK\nNCT06634875\n2\nIsunakinra +/−pembrolizumab\nIL-1R1\nNCT06229340\n2\nleflunomide +/−MEK inhibitor and hydroxychloroquine +/−\nbevacizumab\nDHODH, MEK\nNCT03597581\n1\nOmpenaclid (RGX-202-01) +/−FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI/bevacizumab\nor FOLFOX/bevacizumab\nSLC6A8\nNCT03829410\n1/2\nOnvansertib + FOLFIRI + bevacizumab\nPLK1\nNCT04599140\n(STOPTRAFFIC-1)\n1/2\nSX-682 +/−nivolumab\nCXCR1/2\nMEK inhibitors, such as trametinib and binimetinib, block the downstream MAPK-\nsignaling cascade. MEK inhibitors in combination with various targeted therapies so far\nhave resulted in limited clinical efficacy for KRAS-mutant mCRC, such as SAR405838\n(an HDM2 inhibitor) plus pimasertib (an MEK1/2 inhibitor) [99], afatinib (a pan-HER\ninhibitor) plus selumetinib (an MEK inhibitor) [100], neratinib (a pan-ERBB inhibitor) plus\ntrametinib [101], navitoclax (a Bcl-2 inhibitor) plus trametinib [102], panitumumab plus\ntrametinib [103], and binimetinib plus palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) [104]. Preclinical\nmodels suggest that combining MEK inhibitors with KRAS G12C inhibitors can reduce\nthe feedback reactivation of the pathway and enhance tumor regression [69]. A phase\n1/2 study is underway evaluating the KRAS G12C inhibitor JDQ443 in combination with\ntrametinib for patients with advanced solid tumors, including mCRC (Table 1).\nSimilarly, although RAF inhibitors alone have shown limited success in KRAS-mutant\nCRC, combination strategies targeting RAF and MEK or RAF and EGFR are being explored\nto suppress MAPK signaling and potentially overcome resistance (Table 3). Avutometinib\n(VS-6766) is a unique RAF/MEK clamp that blocks MEK kinase activity and prevents MEK\nphosphorylation by RAF. The preclinical evaluation of avutometinib in combination with\npanitumumab showed significant antitumor activity in CRC PDX models harboring KRAS\nmutations, with more tumor regression observed in a KRAS G12V PDX model than in a\nKRAS G12D model [84].\nThe PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is often upregulated in KRAS-mutant tumors, driving\nresistance to KRAS inhibitors [105]. Targeting this pathway with PI3K inhibitors or dual\nPI3K/mTOR inhibitors is under investigation [106,107]. These agents have been tested in\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n11 of 20\ncombination with KRAS inhibitors to simultaneously block multiple survival pathways in\nNSCLC [108,109].\n4.5. Targeting Other Pathways\nSynthetic lethality occurs when the inhibition of a secondary pathway in a tumor\nharboring a specific mutation (e.g., KRAS) results in cell death [110]. Synthetic lethality in\nKRAS-mutant mCRC represents a promising therapeutic strategy by targeting vulnerabil-\nities specific to KRAS-mutant tumor cells while sparing normal cells. Because the direct\ninhibition of mutant KRAS has historically been challenging, researchers have focused on\nexploiting synthetic lethal interactions, such as targeting DNA damage repair pathways,\nkey metabolic dependencies, and parallel signaling networks, in addition to inhibiting the\nKRAS effector pathways [111]. Understanding these interactions offers new avenues for\novercoming drug resistance and improving outcomes in KRAS-mutant mCRC (Table 3).\nFor example, creatine kinase-B (CKB) has been identified as a cancer driver in KRAS-\nmutant CRC by promoting tumor growth and survival in hypoxia. The energetic metabolite\nphospho-creatine (PCr), generated by CKB, is imported into cells through the creatine trans-\nporter, SLC6A8. The small-molecule SLC6A8 inhibitor RGX-202-01 depletes intracellular\nPCr and ATP and leads to apoptosis. In a phase 1a study, RGX-202-01 monotherapy demon-\nstrated objective antitumor activity for relapsed/refractory KRAS-mutant CRC without\ndose-limiting toxicity. RGX-202-01 in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab was\nwell tolerated in patients with pretreated CRC. Among nine patients with KRAS-mutant\nCRC, the ORR was 56%, and the DCR was 100% [112].\nThe serine/threonine kinase polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) regulates the cell cycle by con-\ntrolling mitotic entry and progression. The selective PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib has shown\npotent antitumor activity in CRC preclinical models, both as a single agent and in com-\nbination with irinotecan. Onvansertib inhibited the hypoxia pathway and demonstrated\npotent antitumor activity in combination with bevacizumab by suppressing angiogenesis.\nAdditionally, the synthetic lethality between PLK1 inhibition and KRAS mutations has been\nobserved in CRC models [113]. Onvansertib combined with FOLIFRI and bevacizumab\nexhibited manageable safety and promising efficacy as a second-line treatment in patients\nwith KRAS-mutant mCRC [113,114].\n4.6. Mutant-KRAS-Targeted Cancer Vaccines\nMutant-KRAS-targeted cancer vaccines are emerging as a promising immunotherapeu-\ntic strategy for KRAS-mutant mCRC. These vaccines aim to stimulate the immune system\nto recognize and attack cancer cells harboring specific neoantigens that are associated with\nKRAS mutations, such as G12D, G12V, or G12C. Peptide-based, mRNA, and dendritic cell\nvaccines are being explored to enhance T-cell responses [115,116]. Recent clinical trials have\ndemonstrated the feasibility and safety of these approaches, with some showing early signs\nof efficacy [9–11]. For example, the cancer vaccine ELI-002 2P consists of the amphiphile\n(Amph) modification of G12D- and G12R-mutant KRAS peptides (Amph-Peptide-2P) and\na CpG oligonucleotide adjuvant (Amph-CpG-7909), which enhances lymph node delivery\nand the immune response. In a phase 1 study, ELI-002 2P induced significant T-cell and\nbiomarker responses in patients with immunotherapy-recalcitrant KRAS-mutant pancreatic\nand colorectal cancers with minimal residual disease (MRD) [10]. ELI-002 7P comprises\namph-peptide 7P (G12X and G12D peptides) and amph-CpG-7909. In patients with pancre-\natic or colorectal cancer with MRD, ELI-002 7P induced higher median T-cell responses than\nELI-002 2P at the recommended phase 2 dose and exhibited early indications of antitumor\nactivity [11]. Challenges such as tumor immune evasion, antigen heterogeneity, and the\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remain to be addressed to improve the\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n12 of 20\nvaccines’ efficacy [115]. Combination strategies with ICI or adoptive T-cell therapies may\nfurther enhance their therapeutic potential in mCRC (Table 4).\nTable 4.

TCR, T-cell receptor.\n4.7. Adoptive T-Cell Therapy\nAdoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is another emerging approach that harnesses the im-\nmune system to specifically target and eliminate tumor cells expressing mutant KRAS.\nStrategies such as T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T-cells and tumor-infiltrating lympho-\ncytes (TILs) are being explored to enhance the immune recognition of KRAS mutations\n(Table 4). It was reported that the adoptive transfer of mutant KRAS-G12D-specific, HLA-\nC*08:02-restricted TILs (CD8+ T-cells) achieved durable tumor regressions in one patient\nwith mCRC [12]. Recent advancements in neoantigen discovery and gene-editing tech-\nnologies, including CRISPR/Cas9, have facilitated the development of highly specific\nTCR-engineered T-cells that recognize mutant KRAS peptides presented by major histo-\ncompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [117,118].\n5. Challenges and Future Perspectives\nDespite the recent advancements in targeting KRAS-mutant CRC, several challenges\nremain in translating these breakthroughs into durable clinical benefits. One major hurdle\nis the heterogeneity of KRAS mutations, which differ in their biological activities and re-\nsponses to therapies [40]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that resistance can emerge\nfollowing treatment with KRAS inhibitors, presenting a major hurdle to sustained therapeu-\ntic benefit. This resistance is driven by diverse mechanisms, including secondary mutations\nin KRAS that impair inhibitor binding; the activation of bypass-signaling pathways, such\nas PI3K-AKT and MAPK; and lineage plasticity, as exemplified by EMT. The feedback acti-\nvation of RTKs, as well as the presence of co-mutations in TP53, STK11, or KEAP1, further\ncomplicate the therapeutic landscape [119,120]. Recent studies have also emphasized the\nroles of TME factors and immune modulation in shaping resistance [121]. Consequently,\nthere is growing interest in combinatorial strategies that integrate KRAS inhibitors with\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n13 of 20\nagents targeting compensatory pathways, immune checkpoints, and epigenetic regulators\nto delay or overcome resistance [122].\nEmerging evidence suggests that transcriptomic adaptations without acquired re-\nsistance mutations can contribute to resistance against anti-EGFR therapy in CRC [123].\nNotably, KRAS mutations have been shown to induce substantial alterations in epige-\nnetic modifications, which may also play a critical role in CRC progression [36]. Recent\nbiomarker analysis from the KRYSTAL-1 trial identified acquired pathogenic alterations\nin 74% (25/34) of the cases [75], suggesting that DNA-driven resistance may represent a\npredominant mechanism of resistance to KRAS inhibitors, albeit with a small sample size.\nAlthough these findings underscore the genetic basis of resistance, the roles of epigenetic\nmodifications in both primary and secondary resistances remain incompletely understood.\nFurther investigations with larger cohorts are warranted to elucidate the interplay between\nepigenetic reprogramming and therapeutic resistance in KRAS-mutant CRC.\nThe exploration of synthetic lethality approaches targeting co-dependencies in KRAS-\ndriven tumors, such as vulnerabilities in the DNA damage response or metabolic pathways,\npresents a novel strategy for therapeutic intervention [36,110,111]. Altered metabolism\nis a hallmark of KRAS-driven CRC, playing crucial roles in both tumor progression and\nresistance to therapy. Oncogenic KRAS mutations reprogram cellular metabolism to boost\nnutrient uptake, glycolysis, and glutamine utilization, thereby supporting rapid prolifer-\nation and survival under the nutrient-deprived and hypoxic conditions of the tumor mi-\ncroenvironment. These metabolic alterations create exploitable vulnerabilities, as targeting\nkey pathways—such as glycolysis, the redox balance, and lipid metabolism—can selec-\ntively disrupt the growth of KRAS-mutant CRC cells while sparing normal tissues [35,124].\nEmerging evidence has shown promise in the therapeutic potential of combining metabolic\ninhibitors with standard treatments to overcome drug resistance and enhance clinical out-\ncomes [125]. A deeper understanding of KRAS-driven metabolic rewiring may pave the\nway for more effective, precision-targeted strategies in this aggressive CRC subtype.\nAnother major obstacle is the immunosuppressive TME commonly linked to KRAS\nmutations. KRAS-mutant CRC often exhibits low tumor mutational burden and poor\nimmune cell infiltration, making it less responsive to ICIs [53]. This highlights the potential\nbenefit of combining KRAS inhibitors with immunotherapy. However, recent clinical trials\nhave highlighted significant toxicity concerns with this approach. Data from the CodeBreaK\n100/101 and KRYSTAL-7 trials, which evaluated KRAS G12C inhibitors in combination with\nanti-PD-(L)1 antibodies, demonstrated a marked increase in grade 3–4 toxicities [126,127].\nOne potential hypothesis is that KRAS-targeted therapies modulate the immune system,\nthereby exacerbating immune-mediated toxicities driven by checkpoint inhibitors, though\nthe precise mechanisms remain unclear [128]. To address these challenges, optimized\ncombination strategies, including refining treatment sequencing, the intermittent dosing\nof KRAS inhibitors, and alternative combination regimens, can be explored to improve\ntolerability while maintaining efficacy [128].\nOther immune-mediated KRAS-targeted approaches, including KRAS vaccines, T-cell\ntherapy, and T-cell engagers, such as BiTEs-KRAS, are currently under investigation [128–130].\nAdditionally, targeting specific immune components, such as macrophages and regulatory\nT-cells, and immunosuppressive co-occurring mutations, like LKB1 and KEAP1 muta-\ntions, can be an area for further exploration [128,131,132]. These strategies could mitigate\nthe immunosuppressive nature of KRAS-mutant cancers, including those of colorectal\norigin. Further investigations are warranted to refine these approaches and assess their\nclinical efficacy.\nLooking ahead, a key focus will be the identification of biomarkers that can pre-\ndict patient responses to KRAS-targeted therapies and support personalized treatment\nCancers 2025, 17, 1512\n14 of 20\nstrategies. For example, ctDNA and liquid biopsies are emerging as valuable tools for\ntracking resistance mechanisms and adjusting treatments in real time by offering dynamic\ninsights into tumor evolution and therapeutic responses [133–135]. Furthermore, multi-\nomic approaches—integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data—along with\nsingle-cell technologies, are anticipated to enhance our understanding of KRAS-driven\nbiology and intratumoral heterogeneity, potentially uncovering novel therapeutic targets\nand effective drug combinations [136]. Innovative treatment modalities are also on the\nhorizon, including RNAi to suppress mutant KRAS expression, CRISPR-based genome\nediting to modify or eliminate oncogenic KRAS alleles, nanoparticle-based delivery plat-\nforms designed to improve drug bioavailability and tumor specificity while minimizing\noff-target effects, and bifunctional PROTACs that harness E3 ubiquitin ligases to target\nKRAS for degradation via the proteasome [13–18,85].\n6. Conclusions\nKRAS mutations represent a critical driver of CRC, contributing to tumorigenesis,\ntherapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis. Although historically deemed as undruggable,\nrecent developments in KRAS-targeted therapies, including G12C inhibitors and combi-\nnation approaches, have begun to shift the treatment paradigm for KRAS-mutant CRC.\nDespite these advances, the modest response rates, emergence of resistance, and limited\ntreatment options for non-G12C mutations underscore the urgent need for continued inno-\nvation. Although significant hurdles remain, the growing understanding of KRAS biology\nand the rapid pace of translational research provide hope for meaningful progress in the\nmanagement of KRAS-mutant CRC. A multidisciplinary approach integrating basic sci-\nence, clinical innovation, and personalized medicine will be essential to overcome current\nchallenges and improve survival and quality of life for these patients.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.M. and R.D.K.; writing—original draft preparation,\nR.M.; writing—review and editing, R.M., J.Y. and R.D.K.; visualization, J.Y.; supervision, R.D.K.

    "summary": "논문 \"대사성 대장암 환자를 위한 KRAS 종양유전자 타겟팅\"에서는 대장암의 주요 원인 중 하나인 KRAS 돌연변이에 대해 다루고 있습니다. 대장암 케이스의 약 40%에서 발견되는 KRAS 돌연변이는 RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) 및 PI3K-AKT-mTOR 같은 주요 신호 전달 경로의 지속적 활성화를 통해 종양 발생을 촉진하고 치료 저항성 및 예후 불량에 기여합니다. 최근에는 KRAS G12C 억제제인 소토라시브와 아다그라시브가 임상 시험에서 효과를 보였으나, 이들의 효능은 KRAS 변이 대장암의 소수 집단에 한정되어 있으며, 보상 경로 활성화를 통한 저항 메커니즘이 자주 나타납니다. 이에 따라 KRAS 억제제와 항-EGFR 에이전트를 조합한 전략이 시도되고 있습니다. 또한, 종양 미세환경이 면역 회피 및 치료 저항성에서 중요한 역할을 하며, 이를 통해 새로운 면역 치료 접근법이 모색되고 있습니다.",

We know that RAS proteins are one of the most commonly mutated proteins in cancer cells.\nThese proteins work like a light switch and mutant RAS remain in the ON position sending signals to\nthe cell to keep dividing when they should not. Until recently, it was thought that all RAS mutations\nwere equal, but differences among these mutants have been identiﬁed. Here we used a technique\ncalled proteomics to decipher the differences among RAS mutants. We ﬁnd that each mutant binds a\ndifferent set of proteins and can regulate different signals. We also ﬁnd that a clinically approved\ndrug that inhibits one RAS mutant regulates the interaction of RAS proteins with other proteins. Our\nﬁndings extend our knowledge of how the RAS mutants work, which can potentially be used to\nimprove cancer treatments.\nAbstract: RAS proteins are key regulators of cell signalling and control different cell functions\nincluding cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Point mutations in the genes of this family\nare common, particularly in KRAS. These mutations were thought to cause the constitutive activation\nof KRAS, but recent ﬁndings showed that some mutants can cycle between active and inactive states.\nThis observation, together with the development of covalent KRASG12C inhibitors, has led to the\narrival of KRAS inhibitors in the clinic. However, most patients develop resistance to these targeted\ntherapies, and we lack effective treatments for other KRAS mutants. To accelerate the development\nof RAS targeting therapies, we need to fully characterise the molecular mechanisms governing\nKRAS signalling networks and determine what differentiates the signalling downstream of the KRAS\nmutants. Here we have used afﬁnity puriﬁcation mass-spectrometry proteomics to characterise\nthe interactome of KRAS wild-type and three KRAS mutants. Bioinformatic analysis associated\nwith experimental validation allows us to map the signalling network mediated by the different\nKRAS proteins. Using this approach, we characterised how the interactome of KRAS wild-type and\nmutants is regulated by the clinically approved KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. In addition, we\nidentiﬁed novel crosstalks between KRAS and its effector pathways including the AKT and JAK-STAT\nsignalling modules.\nKeywords: KRAS; proteomics; JAK1; RADIL; Sotorasib; SOS1\n1. Introduction\nThe three genes of the RAS family, HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, code for four proteins\nand were described 40 years ago [1]. These proteins are members of the small GTPase\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15164141\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n2 of 26\nsuperfamily, and they cycle between an inactive state when they are bound to GDP and\nan active state when they exchange GDP for GTP [2]. Inactivation occurs when GTP is\nhydrolysed to GDP in a reaction that can be catalysed by RAS proteins intrinsic GTPase\nactivity. However, the activation switch of RAS proteins is tightly regulated by several\nproteins including the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that promote the ex-\nchange of GDP for GTP and the RAS GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that accelerate\nthe hydrolysis of GTP. Activated RAS-GTP binds to effector proteins that are ultimately\nresponsible for the (patho)physiological functions mediated by RAS proteins including\nproliferation, migration, and differentiation [3]. Extensive work has identiﬁed more than\n20 bona ﬁde and putative RAS effectors [2]. However, despite intensive research, we lack a\nclear picture on how these proteins regulate their complex signalling networks.\nMutations of the RAS family of genes are common in cancer and they are driving\noncogenes in some of the cancer types with higher prevalence [4]. In cancer cells, the\nthree genes are mutated at different rates. KRAS is the most commonly mutated gene\n(85% of mutations), followed by NRAS (14%), while HRAS mutations are less frequent\n(~1%) [4]. Traditionally, hyperactivating mutations of RAS proteins were thought to lock\nRAS in the active GTP-bound state, due to the conformational changes in protein structure\ncaused by mutations in RAS [1]. However, recent evidence has disproved this dogma as it\nhas been shown that many KRAS mutants retain varying levels of GTPase activities [5–9].\nThe current view is that the amino acid substitution involved is the determining factor of\nKRAS mutant GTPase activity, and subsequent activation of downstream pathways [7].\nBiochemical studies have determined that the KRASG13D mutant has the highest GTPase\nactivity with a 14 times faster GDP–GTP exchange rate than wild-type KRAS (hence\nforth KRAS WT) and nine times slower GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis rate [6,9]. In\nclear contrast, KRASG12V shows a 1.8-fold reduced GDP–GTP exchange rate but it is\ninsensitive to GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis [6]. However, the determination of the\nGTPase activity of the different KRAS mutants is not completed and conﬂicting results in a\nstudy performed in MCF10A breast cancer cells found that KRASG12D and KRASG13D\nmutants had similar GTPase activity to KRAS WT, but that KRASG12C and KRASG12V\nhad higher GTP binding [7]. Importantly, the binding of many KRAS effectors is GTP-\ndependent, including the best characterised KRAS effectors RAF1, PI3K, RALGDS, and\nPLCε [10,11]. Thus, the fact that the different mutants are regulated by GTP/GDP exchange\ncan indicate that different KRAS mutants can have different afﬁnities for interacting proteins\nand some mutations can result in the formation of oncogenic neo-interactions with proteins\nthat do not bind to KRAS WT. This hypothesis is supported by recent data showing that\nKRAS interaction afﬁnity with the RAF RAS-binding domain (RBD) decreases, dependent\non the mutation present at KRAS codons 12, 13, and 61 [9]. In this case, KRASG13D,\nKRASQ61L, KRASG12A, and KRASG12C mutants had only slightly lower interaction\nafﬁnity with RAF-RBD compared with KRAS WT. Conversely, KRASG12V, KRASG12D,\nand KRASG12R mutants had signiﬁcantly lower interaction afﬁnity with RAF-RBD. Thus,\ndifferent types of KRAS mutations can profoundly change the interaction with effectors\nand downstream signalling.\nImportantly, in the last decade there has been a paradigm change in the way we\napproach the development of targeted therapies against RAS-driven tumours. For decades,\nRAS proteins were considered undruggable. The development of a series of covalent\ninhibitors speciﬁc for KRASG12C and the FDA approval of Sotorasib (AMG510) and\nAdagrasib demonstrate that we can develop effective RAS inhibitors, at least for some of\nthe most common mutants [12]. Unfortunately, while the initial response rates to Sotorasib\nand Adagrasib are promising, ranging from 32% to 46%, respectively, in non-small cell\nlung cancer (NSCLC), resistance inevitably develops in these patients [13]. These drugs can\nalso lead to severe side effects in the patients and more information is necessary to fully\ncharacterise their mechanism of action [14].\nTraditionally, all KRAS point mutations observed in human tumours were considered\nto mediate their transforming potential through the same effector pathways. Importantly, in-\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n3 of 26\ncreasing evidence shows that speciﬁc mutations are associated with different transforming\npotential and differential regulation of metastasis in various cell and animal models [7,15].\nThe existence of pathophysiological differences among the different mutant KRAS is further\nsupported by clinical observations indicating that patients with mutant KRAS colorectal\ncancer may respond to targeted therapy depending on the type of point mutation they\nexpress [16]. In particular, KRASG13D but not KRASG12V tumours were shown to be\nsensitive to EGFR inhibition. These differences are probably related to the different GTPase\nactivity of these mutants which likely results in different interactomes associated with\nspeciﬁc KRAS mutants. For this reason, in the past few years, several groups have per-\nformed afﬁnity puriﬁcation mass-spectrometry (AP-MS) studies to characterise the speciﬁc\ninteractome of several mutant KRAS [10]. Collectively, these studies clearly support the\nexistence of speciﬁc mutant KRAS interactomes.\nHere, we extend these studies using AP-MS to compare the interactome of KRAS\nWT, KRASG12V, and KRASG13D in non-tumoral and tumoral cell lines. Using AP-MS\nwe identify speciﬁc transient interactors and novel RAS interactors. We experimentally\nvalidated our ﬁndings, extending our studies to other KRAS mutants, demonstrating that\nKRAS mutants have different afﬁnities for some of their interactors including SOS1. In\nlight of these ﬁndings, we applied our AP-MS proteomic approach to characterise the\neffect of Sotorasib on the interactome of KRASG12C and KRAS WT. Our ﬁndings show\na regulation of the KRASG12C interactome by this drug. Surprisingly, we also see a\nSotorasib-mediated regulation of KRAS WT interacting proteins and an activation of AKT.\nOur analysis identiﬁed a novel interaction of KRASG12C with JAK1, with an unexpected\nregulation of KRAS protein expression by the JAK pathway. We also identiﬁed proteins of\nthe AKT pathway which may be involved in the activation of AKT. Altogether, our results\nexpand our understanding of KRAS signalling networks and provide mechanistic insights\ninto why not all KRAS mutants are created equal.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Cell Culture and Transfection\nHEK293 (ATCC), RAS-less mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) isogenic cell lines [17]\n(from the RAS initiative at Frederick National Laboratory), and HKe-3 (Shirasawa et al.\n1993) cells were maintained in T75 ﬂasks at 37 ◦C in 95% humidiﬁed air containing 5% CO2\nin HEPA class 100 steri-cycle CO2 incubator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Vantaa Finland)\nand cultured in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Foetal Bovine\nSerum and 2 mM L glutamine (all from Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA). NIH3T3 (ATCC)\ncells were maintained at similar conditions and cultured in ﬁltered DMEM containing 10%\nCalf Serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington MA, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were\ntransfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions. All cells were validated by genome sequencing in the last\n12 months. For stimulation with EGF (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), following 24 h trans-\nfection of HEK293 cells, cells were starved for 16 h prior to stimulation with 3 µM EGF\nfor 5 and 10 min, and cells were then lysed. Cells were treated with 5 µM Sotorasib (Med-\nChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) and 5 µM Ruxolitinib (SelleckChem, Berlin,\nGermany) for 24 h in normal growth conditions prior to protein extraction by cell lysis.\n2.2. Immunoblotting, Antibodies and Reagents\nCell extract protein concentrations were measured by Pierce BCA assay (Invitrogen)\nas outlined by the manufacturer’s instruction. Extracts and immunoprecipitates were\ndenaturalised and analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred\nto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and blotted with commercial\nantibodies.

Constructs and siRNA\nConstructs encoding pCEFL-FLAG-KRAS WT, pCEFL-FLAG-KRASG13D, pCEFL-\nFLAG-KRASG12V, pCEFL-FLAG-KRASG12C, pCEFL-FLAG-KRASG12D, pCEFL-HA-\nNRASG12V, pCEFL-HA-KRAS WT, pCEFL-HA-KRASG13D, pCEFL-HA-KRASG12V,\npCEFL-HA-KRASG12C, pCEFL-HA-KRASG12D, and pCEFL-AU5-SOS1 have been de-\nscribed before [18–21]. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against RADIL human (SO-\n2776281G) and mouse (SO-2858456G) and non-targeted were from Dharmacon/Horizon\n(Lafayette, CO, USA).\n2.4. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and in Beads Tryptic Digestion\nCells were transfected with pCEFL-FLAG-KRAS-WT, -KRASG13D, -KRASG12V, -\nKRASG12C, -KRASG12D, and lysed after 48 h in 25 mM HEPES (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl,\n10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA (all Sigma-Aldrich), 1% NP-40 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA,\nUSA), protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Cellular debris was removed by cen-\ntrifugation at 20,000× g at 4 ◦C for 10 min. Baits were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG\nM2 conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). After 2 h incubation at 4 ◦C, immuno-\nprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40 and separated by\nSDS-PAGE. Blots were quantiﬁed using ImageJ version 1.50. For immunoprecipitation\nof endogenous RADIL the lysates were incubated with 10 µL Protein-G Sepharose beads\n(Sigma-Aldrich) with 2.6 µg/mL RADIL antibody at 4 ◦C for 2 h. Samples used in the\nMS analyses were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 conjugated agarose beads,\nperformed as above but after 2 h incubation at 4 ◦C the immunoprecipitates were digested\nwith proteases as described before [22]. Brieﬂy, immunoprecipitates were washed three\ntimes with lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40 and twice with lysis buffer that does not\ncontain NP-40. Proteins were eluted from beads with 2 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5)\ncontaining 5 µg/mL modiﬁed sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for\n30 min. Proteins were digested in 2 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, and 1 mM DTT (all\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich) containing 5 µg/mL modiﬁed sequencing-grade trypsin overnight at\nroom temperature. Peptides were alkylated using iodoacetamide (5 mg/mL) and incubated\nin the dark for 30 min at room temperature. C18 Stage Tips were used to desalt samples,\nas described by [23] and analysed by mass spectrometry. For double digestion, proteins\nwere denatured in 8 M Urea and reduced in 1 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature.\nProteins were alkylated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature with iodoacetamide\n(3 mM). Proteins were digested in 8 M Urea containing 3 ng/µL Lysyl Endopeptidase\n(Lys-C, Osaka, Wako, Japan) for 4 h at 37 ◦C. Samples were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration\nof 2 M Urea and digested again overnight with 3 ng/µL modiﬁed sequencing grade trypsin.\nC18 Stage tips were used to desalt samples, as before, and analysed by mass spectrometry.\n2.5. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Afﬁnity Puriﬁcation-MS (AP-MS)\nExperiment IP KRAS WT, KRASG12V, and KRASG13D: the samples were run on a\nThermoScientiﬁc Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA,\nUSA) connected to Dionex Ultimate 3000 (RSLCnano, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA)\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n5 of 26\nchromatography system. Tryptic peptides were resuspended in 0.5% acetic acid, and 2%\nacetonitrile (both Sigma-Aldrich). Each sample was loaded onto a fused silica emitter,\n75 µm ID, pulled using a laser puller (Sutter Instruments P2000, Novato, CA, USA), packed\nwith Reprocil Pur C18 (1.9 µm, Germany) reverse phase media, and was separated by\nan increasing acetonitrile gradient over 120 min at a ﬂow rate of 200 nL/min. The mass\nspectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a capillary temperature of 320 ◦C,\nand with a potential of 2300 V applied to the frit. All data were acquired with the mass\nspectrometer operating in automatic data-dependent switching mode. A high resolution\n(70,000) MS scan (350–1600 m/z) was performed using the Q-Exactive to select the 12 most\nintense ions prior to MS/MS analysis using HCD.\nExperiment IP Sotorasib treatment KRAS WT and KRASG12C: Samples were analysed\non a Bruker timsTof Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) connected to\nan Evosep One liquid chromatography system (Eveosep, Odense, Denmark) or a Bruker\nnanoElute nanoﬂow chromatography system. In the case of the Evosep platform tryptic\npeptides were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and each sample was\nloaded onto an Evosep tip. The Evosep tips were placed in position on the Evosep One,\nin a 96-tip box. The autosampler was conﬁgured to pick up each tip, and elute and\nseparate the peptides using a set chromatography method (30 samples a day) [24]. For\nthe Bruker nanoElute nano-LC chromatography system, each sample was loaded onto\nAcclaim PepMap C18 trap cartridge (0.3 mm inside diameter, 5 mm length, ThermoFisher\nScientiﬁc) and then separated on an Aurora UHPLC column (25 cm × 75 µm ID, C18,\n1.6 µm, Ionopticks, Fitzroy Australia) with an increasing acetonitrile gradient over 30 min\nat a ﬂow rate of 250 nL/min [25]. The chromatography buffers used for both systems were\nBuffer A: 99.9% water, and 0.1% formic acid; and Buffer B: 99.9% acetonitrile, and 0.1%\nformic acid. All solvents used were LCMS grade. The mass spectrometer was operated\nin positive ion mode with a capillary voltage of between 1600 and 1800 V, dry gas ﬂow\nof 3 L/min and a dry temperature of 180 ◦C. All data were acquired with the instrument\noperating in trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) mode. Trapped ions were selected\nfor ms/ms using parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF). A scan range of\n(100–1700 m/z) was performed at a rate of 5 PASEF MS/MS frames to 1 MS scan with a\ncycle time of 1.03 s [26].\n2.6. Analysis of AP-MS Data\nThe resulting mass spectra were analysed with MaxQuant [27] software, containing\na built-in Andromeda search engine to identify the proteins from the UniProt HUMAN\ndatabase [28] (release 2014_02). Protein interactions were quantiﬁed by LFQ Intensity.\nThis consisted of 3 biological replicates and 2 technical replicates with 3 baits and empty\nvector controls in 2 cell lines. The raw data were searched against the Homo sapiens\nsubset of the Uniprot Swissprot database (reviewed) using the search engine Maxquant\n(release 2.0.1.0) using speciﬁc parameters for trapped ion mobility spectra data-dependent\nacquisition (TIMS DDA). Each peptide used for protein identiﬁcation met speciﬁc Maxquant\nparameters, i.e., only peptide scores that corresponded to a false discovery rate (FDR) of\n0.01 were accepted from the Maxquant database search. The normalized protein intensity\nof each identiﬁed protein was used for label-free quantitation (LFQ) [29].\nContaminants and reverse peptides were removed. The statistical analysis was per-\nformed as previously reported [23,30]. In essence, the average protein interaction for each\nbait was measured by LFQ values. As the ﬁrst step in the analysis, signiﬁcant proteins were\nidentiﬁed in comparison to the empty vector control. The ratio of protein abundance and\nStudent’s t-test were used to select proteins signiﬁcantly interacting with the bait proteins\ncompared with the empty vector control (ratio > 2, p-value < 0.01). Speciﬁc proteins were\npooled. For the experiment performed with HKe-3 cells described in Section 3.2 bait protein\nlevels (KRAS) were assessed and normalised to remove potential protein interaction bias\nfor one bait over the others. The ratio between conditions were calculated pairwise. To\nselect proteins signiﬁcantly interacting compared with other baits, the ratio of each protein,\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n6 of 26\ncombined with Student’s t-test were used to identify proteins signiﬁcantly interacting\n(ratio > 2 OR < 0.5, p-value < 0.01).\nCytoscape (version 3.7.2) was used to construct the interactomes of each KRAS isoform\nin both cell lines. String DB [31], REACTOME [32], and PANTHER databases [33] were used\nfor gene ontology analysis, network reconstruction, and K-means cluster identiﬁcation.\n2.7. Transformation Assay\nTransformation assays were performed as described by Aaronson et al. [34] and\nfurther explained in Herrero et al. [35]. Brieﬂy, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pCEFL-\nHA-KRAS WT, KRASG13D, KRASG12V, KRASG12C, KRASG12D, and/or 20 nM siRNA-\nRADIL. Cells were grown in culture conditions for at least two weeks with the media\nchanged every 2–3 days. When macroscopic foci were visible, the cells were ﬁxed with\nmethanol for 5 min and stained with 5% Giemsa (in PBS) and the transformed foci were\ncounted. The number of foci counted were quantiﬁed relative to 1 µL of DNA. Three\nbiological replicates were quantiﬁed and averaged.\n2.8. Migration Assay\nHKe-3 cells were transfected with pCEFL-FLAG-KRAS-WT, -KRASG13D, -KRASG12V,\n-KRASG12C, -KRASG12D, and +/−4nM siRNA-RADIL; 24 h post-transfection, cells were\ncounted and seeded into migration culture inserts (Ibidi, Grafelding, Germany). Culture\ninserts were removed 24 h post-seeding of cells. Cells were supplemented with DMEM\ncontaining 1% FBS and 1% L-glutamine. Pictures of the cell gap were taken at 0 h, 6 h and\n24 h. The area of the gap was measured using ImageJ. Results were normalised to the 0\nh time point for each condition, as outlined by Cappiello et al. [36] and percentage gap\nclosure was quantiﬁed.\n2.9. Survival Curves\nTo measure survival in HKe-3 we used MTS assays. To perform this, cells were trans-\nfected with pCEFL-FLAG-KRAS-WT, -KRASG13D, -KRASG12V, -KRASG12C, -KRASG12D,\nand/or 10 nM siRNA-RADIL. Cells were collected at the indicated times and MTS assay\nwas performed as outlined by the manufacturer (Promega).\n2.10. Statistics\nTransformation assay: Number of foci were counted and quantiﬁed relative to 1µg\nDNA. Positive (upper) error bars are Max-Q3 (maximum [highest data point in the data\nset]—Q3 [third quartile, the median of the upper half of the dataset]), minus (lower) error\nbars are the error amount set to 100%. Upper (dark grey) boxes are Q3-Med (Q3 [third\nquartile, the median of the upper half of the dataset]—Med [median, the middle value in\nthe dataset]). Lower light grey boxes are Med-Q1 (Med [median, the middle value in the\ndataset]—Q1 [ﬁrst quartile, the median of the lower half of the dataset]). p-values were\ndetermined by two-tail, two-sample equal variance Student’s t-test; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,\n*** p < 0.001; differences without p-values indicated were not signiﬁcant.\nMigration assay: Percentage cell gap was quantiﬁed using ImageJ and normalised to\nthe 0 h time point gap as described by Cappiello et al. [36]. Error bars are +/−standard\nerror of the mean (SEM) of three biological replicates. p-values were determined by two-tail,\ntwo-sample equal variance Student’s t-test; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; differences\nwithout p-values indicated were not signiﬁcant.\nWestern blot quantiﬁcation: Protein band intensity was quantiﬁed by ImageJ. Im-\nmunoprecipitates were normalised to the band intensity of bait proteins, phospho-proteins\nwere normalised to band intensity of the corresponding total-protein levels. All samples\nwere normalised to the control (KRAS WT) levels. p-values were determined by one-tail,\ntwo-sample equal variance Student’s t-test; * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001; differences\nwithout p-values indicated were not signiﬁcant.\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n7 of 26\nMTS cell survival assay: Three biological replicates with three technical replicates\neach.

Results\n3.1. KRAS Mutants Differentially Regulate the RAF and AKT Effector Pathways in HEK293 Cells\nDifferent lines of evidence have shown that the speciﬁc point mutations of the KRAS\noncogene are not equal [37–41]. To obtain a better understanding of the biochemical\nand functional differences among these proteins, we ﬁrst tested the effects of the expres-\nsion of KRAS WT and four of the most common oncogenic KRAS mutants, KRASG13D,\nKRASG12V, KRASG12C, and KRASG12D, on the regulation of ERK and AKT pathways in\nHEK293 cells. As expected, overexpression of KRAS WT caused a modest increase on ERK\nphosphorylation, while overexpression of the four KRAS mutants increased ERK phospho-\nrylation (Figure 1A,B). KRASG12D induced phospho-ERK levels 12-fold compared with\nWT, followed by KRASG12C and KRASG13D with a 7.3- and 5.6-fold increase, respectively.\nKRASG12V was consistently less potent and induced ERK phosphorylation only 3-fold\neven though it was expressed at higher levels than KRASG13D. The effect on the levels of\nphospho-AKT were less striking, but KRASG12C and KRASG12D signiﬁcantly induced\nphosphorylation of this kinase while expression of KRASG13D and KRASG12V had no\neffect (Figure 1A,C). Altogether, the results show that KRASG12C and KRASG12D have\nsimilar effects in the activation of ERK and AKT. KRASG13D does not activate the AKT\npathway while KRASG12V has a lower effect in the activation of the ERK pathway than\nthe other mutants and no effect on the activation of AKT.\nFigure 1.

The KRAS Proteins Interactome Differs between Cell Types\nWe hypothesised that the results of the previous section might be explained, at least\nin part, by differences in the interactome of these mutants. To test this, we performed a\nproteomics screen of KRAS mutants interactomes. In order to facilitate the experimental\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n8 of 26\nanalysis, we selected only two of these mutants, KRASG12V and KRASG13D. The rationale\nfor this selection was that these two KRAS isoforms have the greater variation in the\nGTPase activity and differential response to EGFR inhibitors [7,16], which we reasoned\nmay be due to the presence of very different interactors in their proteomes. We selected the\nhuman HEK-293 cells which are an immortalized cell line commonly used for interaction\nproteomics and has been used to explore RAS proteins interactomes [38,42,43]. Also,\nwe were interested in determining if there are differences in the interactome of these\nmutants in different cell lines and, in particular, in a cancer type where KRAS is commonly\nmutated. In our experience, overexpression of KRAS mutants in cells that have mutations\nin KRAS or BRAF genes is extremely difﬁcult as this seems to result in oncogene-induced\nstress. For this reason, in addition to HEK293 cells, we performed a proteomic screen in\nHKe-3 cells, a colorectal cancer cell line derived from HCT116 cells where the oncogenic\nKRASG13D allele was knocked out that tolerates overexpression of KRAS mutants and we\nused before to perform proteomics screens [44,45]. We transfected FLAG-tagged constructs\nof KRAS WT, KRASG12V, and KRASG13D into these cell types (Figure 2A). Following IP,\nwe determined the speciﬁc interactomes associated with the different KRAS proteins by\nAP-MS. Using label-free quantitation (LFQ), we performed statistical analysis to check if\nthere were signiﬁcant changes in the interactome of the three KRAS proteins expressed in\nthe experiments. A ﬁrst comparison using a Venn diagram representation showed clear\ndifferences in the interactomes associated with KRAS proteins in both cell lines with only\n12 proteins out the 450 speciﬁc interactors being present in KRAS IPs performed in both cell\nlines (Figure 2B and Tables S1 and S2). These results showed that there are very pronounced\ncell speciﬁc differences in the interactome of KRAS proteins. To continue the systematic\nanalysis, we focused on the differences in the interactome for the three KRAS baits in each\ncell line.\nIn HEK293 cells, 1530 proteins were identiﬁed in the screening, of which 400 were\nspeciﬁcally binding to at least one of the KRAS proteins (Figures 2B,C and S1 and Table S1).\nUsing the statistical analysis explained in the material and methods section, we observed\nremarkable variations on the number of proteins binding to each of the KRAS proteins.\nAs expected, there were common interactors to KRAS WT, KRASG13D, and KRASG12V\n(193), and other proteins were interacting with two of them (Figure 2C). Conversely, there\nwere 46 proteins exclusively interacting with KRAS WT. In the case of the KRAS mutants,\nwe also identiﬁed proteins exclusively binding to one of them with 48 proteins shown\nas unique KRASG13D interactors and only 16 shown as speciﬁc for KRASG12V. Similar\nresults were observed in HKe-3 cells, although with clear differences in the distribution of\nthe interactome (Figures 2D and S2 and Table S2). In HKe-3 cells, we identiﬁed signiﬁcantly\nfewer proteins (713 proteins), of which 62 proteins were shown as speciﬁc KRAS interactors.\nAs in HEK293 cells the three proteins expressed shared part of the interactome, but only\n11 proteins were common interactors. The most remarkable observation in these cells was\nthat KRASG13D interacted with 22 proteins, a much lower number than the 40 binders\nof KRAS WT and the 41 interactors of KRASG12V. Despite these differences, all KRAS\nisoforms have unique interactors, with KRAS WT having the highest number (13), followed\nby KRASG12V and KRASG13D (13 and 7, respectively). Altogether, these results show that\nthere are clear differences in the interactomes of the three KRAS isoforms and that they\nshow cell speciﬁc characteristics.\nNext, we evaluated the quality of our experiments by focusing on the proteins identi-\nﬁed in our experiments. Several known RAS interactors were found in the analysis of the\nproteomic interaction data including proteins that have been identiﬁed in previous pro-\nteomics screenings performed with other methods such as BioID and AP-MS, among them\nthe RAS effectors RAF1, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, RADIL, or mTOR [37,39,40,46,47] (Figures\n2E–N and S2). The high enrichment of known KRAS interactors in our datasets demonstrate\nthe validity of our method to investigate the speciﬁc interactomes of the different KRAS\nisoforms. Moreover, LFQ allowed us to ﬁnd changes of afﬁnity between the different KRAS\nbaits and speciﬁc proteins. For instance, RAF1, BRAF, and ARAF have higher afﬁnity for\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n9 of 26\nKRAS mutants than for KRAS WT in HEK293 cells (Figures 2E,F,J,K and S3A). However,\nwhile BRAF and RAF1 have similar afﬁnity for both KRAS mutants, ARAF shows a higher\nafﬁnity for KRASG12V (Figure S3A). Importantly, in HKe-3 cells we saw further differences\nin the interaction of KRAS proteins with RAF family proteins. ARAF was not identiﬁed,\nand we saw that both RAF1 and BRAF have much higher afﬁnity for KRASG13D than\nfor KRASG12V (Figure 2J,K) indicating that there are cell speciﬁc factors that regulate the\ninteraction of the KRAS mutants with RAF family effectors.\nFigure 2. (A) Graphical representation of the mass spectrometry afﬁnity puriﬁcation protocol for\nKRAS WT, KRASG13D, and KRASG12V in HEK293 and HKe-3 cell lines. Cells were transfected\nwith FLAG-tagged KRAS WT, G13D, and G12V DNA constructs. Cells were lysed after 48 h and\nincubated with FLAG-M2 conjugated to agarose. Following washes of the beads with lysis buffer,\nsamples were prepared for trypsin digestion. Mass spectrometer protein searches of the raw data\nwere conducted using Max Quant to quantify protein abundance associated with each bait. LFQ\nintensity of the protein for each condition was used to identify speciﬁc KRAS interactors in both cell\nlines. Created with BioRender.com. (B) Venn diagram representing the number of specific protein\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n10 of 26\ninteractions binding to KRAS proteins (sorted by gene name) in HEK293 and HKe-3 cell lines (C) Venn\ndiagram representing the speciﬁc interactors of the indicated KRAS proteins identiﬁed in AP-MS\nproteomics in HEK293 and (D) HKe-3 cell lines.

(J–N) graphs show the average LFQ in HKe-3 cells of the\nindicated proteins in immunoprecipitates of KRAS WT, KRASG13D or KRASG12V as indicated\n(n = 3). Error bars show SEM.\nOther known interactors of KRAS observed in the analysis of the HEK293 cells in-\ncluded MLLT4, SOS1, RHOA, RHOC, HRAS, and NRAS. Interactors of KRAS observed in\nthe HKe-3 cell line included RIN1, ROCK1, HRAS, and NRAS. Interestingly, but perhaps\nnot surprisingly, we saw that similar to ARAF some of these known interactors were only\ndetected in one of the cell lines. For instance, MLLT4 and SOS1 were speciﬁc to the KRAS\ninteractome in HEK293 cells (Figures 2H and S3B). On the other hand, the RAS effector\nRIN1 was only identiﬁed in HKe-3 cell IPs and showed higher afﬁnity for KRASG13D\n(Figure 2M). This disparity in the number of interactors may be due to the expression levels\nof these proteins in both cell lines or can be speciﬁc to certain cell types, tissues, or the\nmutational status of oncogenic cell lines. In the case of the KRAS-RIN1 interaction, RIN1 is\nnot expressed in HEK293 cells according to the Human Protein Atlas [48], explaining why\nwe do not see this interaction in HEK293. CAT, MAPK3, NRAS, and DOCK7, which were\nshown to interact with KRAS baits only in HKe-3 cells (Figures 2N, S2 and S3F and Table\nS2), are expressed in both cell lines suggesting that these interactions are cell type-speciﬁc.\n3.3. Bioinformatic Characterisation of KRAS Protein Signalling Networks Show Correlation\nbetween KRAS Protein Interactomes and Function\nWe used gene ontology (GO) and pathway reconstruction to broadly determine the\nphysiological and pathophysiological relevance of our ﬁndings. Panther GO enrichment\nanalysis [49] showed some cell-type-speciﬁc variations in biological processes mediated by\nthe KRAS proteins as a whole. For example, transporter activity GO is overrepresented\nin HEK293 but not in HKe-3 while the developmental process is enriched in HKe-3 cells\n(Figure 3A). Differences are also shown within each cell type for the GO enriched for speciﬁc\nmutants. For instance, in HEK293 cells the KRASG12V and KRASG13D interactomes are\nsigniﬁcantly enriched in proteins involved in signalling processes and protein binding\nversus KRAS WT (Figure S4A,C). However, little differences between KRASG13D and\nKRASG12V were observed. Clearer differences between KRASG12V and KRASG13D\ninteractomes were shown in the HKe-3 cell line (Figure S4B,D). In these cells, KRAS WT\nand KRASG12V showed similar percentages of proteins involved in cellular and metabolic\nprocesses compared with the KRASG13D mutant which had more proteins involved in\nadhesion and in catalytic activity (Figure S4B,D).\nNext, to obtain a network view of the interactomes associated with the three KRAS\nproteins in the two cell lines we used StringDB [31]. In HEK293 cells, the network showed a\nhigh number of connections between KRAS (Figure S4E, red halo), which is to be expected\nas the dataset includes some of the best-known interactors such as RAF1, BRAF, and FNTA.\nRepresentation of a subnetwork containing highly enriched functional clusters identiﬁed an\noverrepresentation of proteins that are involved in metabolic processes, mTOR signalling,\nand Ras GTPase binding and cell cycle (Figure 3B and Table S3). In the case of HKe-3, the\nsignalling network of speciﬁc KRAS interactors showed an enrichment of proteins involved\nin different aspects of RNA binding and metabolism (Figure 3C). Altogether, these results\nconﬁrm that the interactomes of KRAS are cell-type-speciﬁc and different KRAS proteins\nregulate speciﬁc effector pathways and functions which is in line with ﬁndings in recently\npublished interactome studies [10].\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n11 of 26\nFigure 3.

Experimental Validation Conﬁrms That KRAS Proteins Interactomes Are Differentially\nRegulated by KRAS Point Mutation and Shows That RADIL Mediates KRAS-Dependent\nMigration in a Mutant Speciﬁc Manner\nSeveral of the ﬁndings described above can be of special functional relevance. In\nparticular, we were intrigued by the observation that SOS1 might have different afﬁnities\nfor KRASG12V and KRASG13D in HEK293 cells (Figure 2H, of note this interactor was not\nidentiﬁed in HKe-3). To validate this ﬁnding, we performed IP experiments in HEK293\ncells co-transfected with AU5-SOS1 and FLAG-KRAS constructs. Of note, SOS1 expression\nlevels were consistently lower when KRAS WT was expressed in these cells than when we\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n12 of 26\nexpressed KRAS mutant constructs indicating that KRAS WT overexpression can regulate\nSOS1 levels by yet uncharacterised mechanisms. Nevertheless, as shown in the proteomics\nexperiment, SOS1 had a higher afﬁnity for KRASG13D than for KRASG12V (Figure 4A).\nInterestingly, KRAS WT had the highest afﬁnity for SOS1 than any of the KRAS mutants.\nThis disparity might be explained by the fact that we immunoprecipitated SOS1 while in\nthe screen we pulled down KRAS complexes. Additionally, we could see that KRASG12C\nhas similar afﬁnity for SOS1 as KRASG13D, while KRASG12D has a higher afﬁnity for\nSOS1 and KRASG12V has the lowest afﬁnity. These differential afﬁnities of KRAS mutants\nfor SOS1 might have important implications in tumours, as KRAS binds to SOS1 in the\nenzymatic pocket but can also regulate its function by binding to an allosteric regulatory\npocket [50]. Unfortunately, our attempts to experimentally distinguish the contribution of\nthe two binding sites were not conclusive.\nFigure 4. (A) HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged KRAS proteins and\nAU5-SOS1. Cells were lysed after 48 h and IP of AU5-SOS1 was performed using the speciﬁc antibody.\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n13 of 26\nIPs and cell extracts were blotted with the indicated antibodies.

Numbers show average number of foci per 1 ug DNA\n+/−standard deviation (SD) (n = 3). (G) Cells transfected as in A were grown to conﬂuence in a\nplate with a rubber stopper. Stoppers were removed and images were taken at the indicated times.\nPercentage gap closure was quantiﬁed using ImageJ and results were normalised to 0 h time point\nmeasurements [36]. Error bars are SEM. ** p value < 0.01, * p value < 0.05.\nWe also conﬁrmed that RIN1 expression is not detected in HEK293 cells, but it is\nexpressed in HKe-3 cells where it binds better to KRASG13D than KRASG12V or KRAS\nWT (Figure 4B). Finally, we validated the differential interaction of RADIL with the three\nKRAS proteins used in the proteomics experiments in both cell lines. In this case, we did\nsee a very weak interaction with KRAS WT while the two mutants had higher afﬁnity, with\nKRASG13D having the highest afﬁnity for RADIL. Moreover, our results showed that the\ndifferential afﬁnity of RADIL for the KRAS mutant isoforms also extends to the mutants\nKRASG12C and KRASG12D, that bind this protein with lower afﬁnity than KRASG13D\nwith KRASG12D, showing the lowest afﬁnity of all the mutants tested (Figure 4C,D). In\norder to test if activation of KRAS WT increases its interaction with RADIL, we treated\nHEK293 cells with EGF, which caused a clear increase in KRAS WT-RADIL interaction\n(Figure 4E). This is similar to recent observations showing that RADIL interaction is in-\ncreased upon KRAS WT activation [43]. Importantly, when we performed these exper-\niments, RADIL was not considered a KRAS interactor but since then, data from other\ninteraction proteomic studies identiﬁed this protein as one of the main interactors in\nAP-MS experiments using different RAS proteins [37].\nOur results conﬁrm that RADIL is an important KRAS interactor protein that is differ-\nentially regulated by speciﬁc KRAS point mutations. Choi et al. showed that this protein\nmediates KRAS-dependent proliferation and focal adhesion formation [43] and, Kelly et al.\nsaw that RADIL mediates KRAS-dependent migration [37]. We decided to extend the\nfunctional characterisation of this interactor with the different KRAS mutants through\nfunctional biological assays. We ﬁrst tested the possible role of RADIL in KRAS-dependent\ncell viability by knocking down RADIL with speciﬁc siRNA in HKe-3 cells expressing the\ndifferent KRAS mutants. Although RADIL knockdown by speciﬁc siRNA was efﬁcient\n(Figure S5A), neither expression of the different KRAS proteins nor downregulation of\nRADIL expression affected cell viability (Figure S5A). Next, we tested the role of RADIL in\nKRAS-mediated transformation by performing a focus formation assay in NIH3T3 cells.\nWe transfected the cells with KRAS WT and the 4 KRAS mutants and downregulated\nRADIL protein expression by co-transfection of RADIL siRNA. All KRAS mutants induced\nthe formation of transformed foci, although with clear differences (Figures 4F and S5C).\nKRASG13D showed the lowest transformation effect similar to KRAS WT, while KRASG12V,\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n14 of 26\nKRASG12C, and KRASG12D produced 5–8 times more transformed foci than KRASG13D.\nThis result is in line with previous data showing that KRASG13D has lower transformation\nefﬁcacy [15,51]. Downregulation of RADIL did not show a statistically signiﬁcant effect on\nthe number of foci induced by the different mutants (Figures 4F and S5B). Finally, given\nthe known involvement of RADIL in cell motility [43] we studied the role of RADIL in\nKRAS-dependent migration using a wound healing assay. Downregulation of RADIL alone\ndid not have any effect on the migration of HKe-3 cells (Figures 4G and S5C). Surpris-\ningly, KRASG12D was the only KRAS protein that caused an increase in the migration of\nthese cells. Importantly, this effect is mediated by RADIL as its downregulation reduced\nKRASG12D-dependent migration. Remarkably, RADIL seems to be a downstream effector\nof another mutant, KRASG12V, which did not increase migration in these cells. In this\ncase, downregulation of RADIL increased migration of KRASG12V-expressing cells. Thus,\nRADIL might be playing different roles in the migration of tumour cells that express speciﬁc\nKRAS point mutations. This result strengthens the idea that not all the KRAS mutants have\nthe same functions.\n3.5. Sotorasib Shows Off-Target Effects in Cells That Do Not Express KRASG12C\nThe previous results clearly showed that there are changes in the interactome of KRAS\nmutants that can be of relevance for the initiation, development, and evolution of KRAS\ntumours. In light of these results, we tested whether the mechanism of action of the newly\napproved KRASG12C inhibitors includes the speciﬁc regulation of KRASG12C effector\npathways mediated by changes in the interactome. For this, we monitored the effects of\nthe KRASG12C mutant inhibitor, Sotorasib, on the regulation of the best characterised\nRAS effector pathways, RAF and AKT, in cell lines that express different KRAS mutants.\nSotorasib inhibits KRASG12C at nM concentrations but in different studies is used at a wide\nrange of concentrations [14,52]. Importantly, different groups are using high concentrations\nof Sotorasib (5–10 µM) to generate resistant cell lines that can be used to characterise the\nmechanisms of resistance to this drug [53–55]. For this reason, we decided to use high\nconcentrations of Sotorasib in this part of the study. We used RASless mouse embryonic\nﬁbroblasts (MEFs) generated by Drosten et al. [17] that express one of the KRAS mutants and\nnone of the other RAS (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS) genes. The advantage of these cell lines\nis that we avoid any unspeciﬁc regulation of RAS signalling effector pathways that might\nbe induced by Sotorasib treatment. In addition to MEF-KRASG12C, we assessed the effect\nof Sotorasib in MEF-KRAS WT, KRASG12V, and KRASG12D cells should not be affected\nby treatment with this drug even at these high concentrations [55]. Sotorasib treatment of\nMEF-KRASG12C caused a band shift in this mutant due to the covalent binding of this drug.\nThis band shift did not occur in the other KRAS proteins (Figure 5A and Figure S6A). As\nexpected, Sotorasib only inhibited activating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and ERK induced\nfeedback phosphorylation of RAF1 in MEF-KRASG12C conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of this\ndrug for this mutant. Similar results were observed in HEK293 cells where we could\nsee that Sotorasib inhibits KRASG12C-dependent activation of the three core kinases of\nthe ERK pathway (Figure 5B). We also observed an increase in AKT phosphorylation,\nsimilar to what has been described before in cancer cells [56]. Surprisingly, Sotorasib\nupregulated phospho-AKT in all four MEF cell lines, especially in MEF cells expressing\nKRASG12D (Figure 5A and Figure S6A). The results clearly indicate that Sotorasib must\nhave other targets that regulate AKT activation independent of KRASG12C. Interestingly,\nthese targets seem cell-type-speciﬁc, as the induction of pAKT by Sotorasib was observed\nin MEFs and HKe-3 (Figure S6C), but not in HEK293 cells (Figure 5B and Figure S6B). As\npAKT is constitutively upregulated in Sotorasib-resistant lung and pancreatic cancer cell\nlines [57], the off-target activation of AKT may be relevant for the development of resistance\nto Sotorasib.\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n15 of 26\nFigure 5. (A) MEF-KRASG12C, -KRASG12V, and –KRASG12D were treated with the indicated\namount of Sotorasib for 24 h. Cells were lysed, and the indicated proteins were blotted using the\nspeciﬁc antibodies.

Sotorasib Regulates the KRASG12C Interactome and Has Unspeciﬁc Effects on the KRAS\nWT Interactome\nTo characterise if Sotorasib’s mechanism of action involves changes in the KRASG12C\ninteractome, we used the AP-MS proteomic approach described above. Unfortunately,\nMEF-KRASG12C cells cannot be used for AP-MS experiments, as the KRASG12C protein\nis not tagged and there are no suitable antibodies available for immunoprecipitating\nendogenous RAS and its effector proteins. Therefore, we used HEK293 cells transfected\nwith FLAG-KRASG12C or FLAG-KRAS WT for comparison. Despite the fact that we\nimmunoprecipitated similar amounts of KRAS WT and KRASG12C and Sotorasib treatment\ndoes not affect their protein expression, we saw lower level of KRASG12C in AP-MS\n(Figures 6A,B and S7A and Table S4). This suggested that KRASG12C structure and\nSotorasib binding interfered with the trypsin digestion of FLAG-KRASG12C that is part of\nthe sample preparation for MS. It is well-known that some protein conformations can be\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n16 of 26\nresistant to trypsin digestion [58], and it seems that Sotorasib can induce such a protease-\nresistant conformation in KRASG12C. To test this, we performed double digestion with\ntrypsin and LysC, which allowed the full digestion of untreated FLAG-KRASG12C and\nimproved the digestion of Sotorasib-bound KRASG12C (Figure S7A,B). The partial trypsin\nresistance of KRASG12C, however, did not affect the digestion of interacting proteins\nco-precipitating with FLAG-KRASG12C (Figure S7C–F). Hence, we used standard trypsin\ndigestion in the AP-MS experiments to study the effect of Sotorasib on its interactome, as\nthe dataset was of better quality.\nFigure 6.

(D,E) Graphs show average LFQ intensity of the indicated proteins in the\ndifferent IPs. Error bars show SEM. * p value < 0.05, ** p value < 0.01.\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n17 of 26\nComparing the interactomes of FLAG-KRAS WT and FLAG-KRASG12C plus/minus\nSotorasib treatment showed that 41 proteins were exclusively bound to KRASG12C and\n110 interacted only with KRAS WT (Figure 6C). Of the 246 proteins that are speciﬁ-\ncally interacting with KRASG12C, 43 are exclusively binding when the cells are treated\nwith Sotorasib, and 76 proteins are speciﬁcally interacting with KRASG12C in untreated\ncells (Figures 6C and S7G,I). Remarkably, we also observed that Sotorasib impacts the com-\nposition of the KRAS WT interactome; 55 proteins are only present in Sotorasib-treated\ncells and 39 in untreated cells. Additionally, we could see clear regulation of proteins\nthat are interacting with both baits in treated and untreated conditions (Figures 6D,E and\nS7H,J) including the best-known interactors of KRAS, RAF1, and BRAF. Thus, our screen\nshows that Sotorasib changed both the KRASG12C and KRAS WT interactomes. In par-\nticular, the drug abolished the strong interactions of RAF1 and BRAF with KRASG12C,\nwhich explains the inhibition of ERK activation (Figure 6D). The binding to KRAS WT was\nmuch weaker and was not affected by Sotorasib. MLLT4 (Afadin), RADIL, and RAP1GDS\nshowed a similar behaviour (Figures 6D and S7I). Both MLLT4 and RADIL are bona ﬁde\nRAS interactors that bind to GTP-loaded RAS [41,43]. Therefore, this pattern of binding\nand inhibition by Sotorasib is expected. Interestingly, Sotorasib also reduced the strong\nbinding of NRAS to KRAS WT and the weaker binding to KRASG12C (Figure 6E). These\ninteractions may rely on activation, i.e., GTP-dependent, but not mediated through the\neffector domain. These results suggest that Sotorasib interferes with RAS oligomerization\nand nanoclustering, which are important for RAS function [59]. Binding to LAMTOR3,\nFYN, and STOM, which was stronger in KRAS WT, was increased by Sotorasib treatment\nin KRASG12C (Figures 6E and S7J). Interestingly, Sotorasib increased the binding to some\nproteins. For instance, binding to JAK1 was increased in both KRAS WT and KRASG12C\n(Figures 6E and S7I,J). Altogether, these results suggest indirect or off-target effects, which\ncan contribute to the Sotorasib mode of action as they affect signalling molecules that play\nimportant roles in malignant transformation.\n3.7. Sotorasib Regulates KRASG12C and WT Signalling Networks\nWe continued our analysis to obtain a systematic view of the Sotorasib-induced\nchanges on the speciﬁc interactomes of KRASG12C and KRAS WT. First, we reconstructed\nthe interaction network of proteins that are binding to each bait using the STRING database\n(Figure S8A,B). The networks are extremely complex and show a high degree of connection\namong the nodes, which complicates the identiﬁcation and representation of functionally\nrelevant ﬁndings. For this reason, we represented the sub-network of the proteins that are\nchanging their interaction with RAS upon Sotorasib treatment. In the case of KRASG12C,\nfunctional analysis conﬁrms that there is an enrichment of proteins that are part of the\nAKT and ERK signalling pathways conﬁrming the central role of these pathways in the\nmechanism of action of Sotorasib (Figure 7A). The changes of interaction of these nodes\nlikely have an effect in some of the proteins that are part of these pathways but do not\nchange their interaction with KRASG12C in our screen including PIK3R1/2 (the regulatory\nsubunits of PI3K) or ILK. Interestingly, this analysis shows an increase in interaction with\nproteins involved in the functions of the lysosome including STOM, LAMTOR3, and several\nmembers of the ATPV6 complex (grey area Figure 7A). An association of KRAS4B with\nATPV6 and lysosomal localisation was described before [38]. Thus, our data indicate that\nSotorasib induces the localisation of KRAS in the lysosome. Intriguingly, a similar analysis\nof Sotorasib-regulated KRAS WT network identiﬁed a decrease in interaction of this protein\nwith the ATPV6 complex indicating that Sotorasib prevents KRAS WT localisation to the\nlysosome (Figure 7B). Conversely, proteins involved in RNA recognition motif have an\nincreased binding to KRAS WT treated with Sotorasib. Finally, JAK1 interaction with\nKRASG12C and KRAS WT is increased in cells treated with Sotorasib conﬁrming that this\ndrug promotes the interaction of this kinase with KRAS proteins. Altogether, these analyses\nshowed that Sotorasib regulates the KRASG12C interactome but also has clear effect in the\nregulation of the KRAS WT interactome.\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n18 of 26\nFigure 7.

[14]. (D) Network\nconstructed using string DB of the 15 proteins that are in the intersection of the Venn diagram shown\nin (C). Edges show evidence for interaction (high conﬁdence).\nAlthough Sotorasib is approved as a KRASG12C-speciﬁc inhibitor, different groups\nhave identiﬁed other proteins that bind this drug and we reasoned that some of these\ntargets might also be part of the KRAS interactome [14,52,60,61]. To explore this, we used\ninformation from one of the studies that have identiﬁed proteins that are targeted by\nSotorasib using an MS-based approach [14]. This study identiﬁed 183 proteins that bind\nSotorasib and using a Venn diagram analysis we saw that 15 Sotorasib target proteins were\nidentiﬁed in our screen as part of the interactome of KRAS proteins (Figure 7C). Importantly,\nthese proteins form a highly connected network and include proteins from the cytoskeleton\nincluding VIM, ACTB, and TUB1A/B; and the member of the 14-3-3 proteins YWHAQ\nwhich are key regulators of KRAS downstream effectors (Figure 7D). These data indicate\nthat at least some of the changes in KRASG12C and KRAS WT interactomes induced by\nSotorasib treatment might be caused by Sotorasib directly targeting protein interactors\nof KRAS.\n3.8. Validation Experiments Show a New Sotorasib-Regulated Crosstalk of RAS Signalling\nwith JAK1\nTo experimentally validate our proteomics results, we performed KRAS immuno-\nprecipitation assays and monitored the dynamics of the interaction of KRAS WT and\nKRASG12C and several of the proteins shown to be changing in the proteomics analysis.\nWe conﬁrmed that RADIL, RAF1, and BRAF interaction with KRASG12C was severely\ndisrupted by Sotorasib in HEK293 cells (Figure 8A). Similar results were observed in HKe-3\ncells for the interaction of KRASG12C with RADIL and RIN1 which are also downregulated\nby Sotorasib (Figure 8B). These validation experiments conﬁrmed that our AP-MS method\naccurately identiﬁed changes induced by Sotorasib in the interactome of these KRAS pro-\nteins. They may differentially regulate its effector signalling pathways and therefore need\nto be understood to fully characterise the full mode of action of Sotorasib.\nOne of the KRAS effector pathways that our results indicated to be modulated by\nSotorasib is the JNK stress pathway, which was shown to be regulated in KRASG12C-\nexpressing HEK293 cells. Indeed, we observed a clear KRASG12C-dependent activation of\nJNK that was completely abolished by Sotorasib treatment (Figure 8C). JAK1 signalling\nactivation by KRASG12C induced phosphorylation of the STAT3, which was prevented by\nSotorasib treatment (Figure 8C). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration\nthat JAK1-STAT signalling may be a KRAS effector pathway, and that this pathway is\nmodulated by KRASG12C speciﬁc inhibitors.\nJAK1 has been shown to regulate AKT1 in some cases [62], and we wondered whether\nJAK1 activation is related to Sotorasib-induced AKT activation. We tested this using Rux-\nolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor used in the clinic [63], alone, or in combination with Sotorasib.\nIn MEF-KRASG12C cells, there was a much lower level of STAT3 phosphorylation than\nin MEF-KRAS WT, but in both cell lines, addition of the JAK inhibitor clearly decreased\nthe activation of STAT3 (Figure 8D). No changes in AKT1 phosphorylation were observed\nupon Sotorasib and Ruxolitinib combination treatment in MEF-KRASG12C cells indicating\nthat JAK1 is not responsible for the Sotorasib-induced AKT activation in this cell line. In\nthe case of MEF-KRAS WT, combination of Sotorasib and Ruxolitinib induced an increase\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n20 of 26\nin AKT phosphorylation indicating that the crosstalk of this protein with JAK is different to\nthe KRASG12C-JAK1 crosstalk (Figure 8D). Similarly, we observed an increase in ERK1/2\nphosphorylation in MEF-KRAS WT cells treated with Ruxolitinib, while the same treatment\ndid not have any effect in ERK1/2 activation in MEF-KRASG12C. Finally, we observed\nan increase in caspase three cleavage in cells treated with the combination of KRASG12C\nand JAK1/2 inhibitors in MEF-KRAS WT but not in cells treated with either one of the\ntreatments. In MEF-KRASG12C caspase cleavage was higher in all treatment conditions, in-\ndicating that there is an increase in apoptotic signalling in these cells. Finally, an important\nobservation from these treatments was a conspicuous increase in the expression of KRAS\nWT and KRASG12C in cells treated with Ruxolitinib. This unexpected observation indicates\nthat JAK signalling has an important role in the regulation of KRAS protein expression.\nAltogether, these results validate the ﬁndings from our proteomic screening and extend the\ncharacterisation of Sotorasib’s mechanism of action.\nFigure 8.

Discussion\nOur study aimed to extend our characterisation of KRAS-interacting proteins and\nmapping the signalling networks regulated by KRAS WT and oncogenic mutants. The\ninitial proteomics screen clearly showed that KRAS WT and two of the most common KRAS\nmutants, KRASG12V and KRASG13D, interact with different afﬁnities to speciﬁc binding\nproteins. These results also show that the interactome of these proteins varies in the three\ncell lines that we used for the study. These ﬁndings are in line with several works that have\nused different MS-based proteomics approaches to identify the interactome of different\nRAS proteins [10,37–41,46,47,64]. One of the challenges of using AP-MS approaches is\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n21 of 26\nthat some of the protocols used might not be suitable to identify transient interactions.\nTo overcome this problem, several of the proteomic screens performed so far have used\nBioID [5,64], which potentially can identify transient and weak interactions of proteins\nwithin a ~10 nm radius of the bait [65]. However, our more direct approach clearly identiﬁes\ninteractors that have transient interaction with KRAS including the main effectors RAF1,\nBRAF, and PI3K. Moreover, we can quantify differences in afﬁnities of a signiﬁcant number\nof known and newly identiﬁed KRAS interactors including the best characterised GEF of\nthe RAS family SOS1 [2] in HEK293 cells which, to the best of our knowledge, has not\nbeen identiﬁed using any other MS-based approaches reported to date. In the proteomics\ndataset SOS1 was shown to have much higher afﬁnity for KRASG13D than KRASG12V\nand experimentally we show that KRASG12D and KRASG13D have the highest afﬁnity\nfor SOS1 while KRASG12V has very low afﬁnity. This is an unexpected observation as\nKRASG13D was shown to be less dependent on SOS1 for activation than KRASG12V [9].\nAlthough the functional relevance of this ﬁnding needs further studies, it is possible that\nthe mutants with higher afﬁnity can be binding to an allosteric pocket described by Bar\nSagi’s group which regulates a positive feedback loop that has been proposed to promote\ntumorigenesis by activating RAS WT isoforms [50]. This might explain the higher level of\nactivation of ERK1/2 when we overexpress KRASG13D.\nOur method is also simpler to perform, as it does not rely on the expression of biotin\nligase fusion proteins. It must be noted that a disadvantage of both methods is that it is not\npossible to differentiate between direct and indirect interactors of KRAS which requires\nfurther experimental validation or the use of crosslinking protocols suitable for AP-MS\nproteomics. Nevertheless, our approach is clearly suited to identify dynamic changes in\nKRAS protein interactomes and shows a great sensitivity to identify true interactors. This\nis extensively conﬁrmed experimentally with our validation of the interaction of SOS1,\nRIN1, and RADIL with KRAS WT, KRASG12V, and KRASG13D. Our characterisation of the\nspeciﬁc interactomes associated with KRAS mutants has been extended by including in our\nvalidation experiments two additional KRAS isoforms, KRASG12C and KRASG12D, which\nalso show differential binding to several of the proteins studied. Hence, the work presented\nhere elucidates a complex signalling network that shows common and speciﬁc modules for\neach KRAS isoform tested and further contributes to identify the growing number of RAS\neffector pathways. It must be noted that overexpression of RAS proteins and in particular\nKRAS mutant proteins at similar levels is sometimes challenging as shown in several of our\nexperiments and in the literature [35,66]. Remarkably, this was also shown in the MEFs cells\nthat express different levels of each KRAS mutant. This might be due to activation of pro-\napoptotic signals by some mutants [67], rare codon stabilisation of KRAS transcripts [68], or\nexistence of expression sweet spots [69]. To take these variations into account and minimise\noverinterpretation, we made sure that in all the immunoprecipitation experiments we have\nsimilar levels of KRAS proteins and quantiﬁed our results. Nevertheless, the ﬁndings\nfurther support the idea that not all KRAS mutations are equal, and that a given point\nmutation may be associated with speciﬁc pathological effects in tumour cells’ signalling\nnetworks. Overall, the results from our study must be considered in conjunction with\nprevious reports that focus on mapping RAS protein interactomes and highlight the need\nto extend these screens to identify cell speciﬁc proteomes of all RAS isoforms.\nImportantly, our work goes further than previous proteomics screens as, for the ﬁrst\ntime, we characterised the changes caused by Sotorasib in the KRAS WT and KRASG12C\ninteractomes. This KRASG12C-speciﬁc inhibitor is already approved for the treatment\nof lung cancer but resistance to treatment develops quickly [13]. Additionally, unspeciﬁc\neffects have been reported and it has also been shown to have effects in cell lines regardless\nof KRAS mutation status [70,71]. Reports also indicate that several patients develop severe\nside effects which indicate that at therapeutic concentration the drug has a systemic impact\naffecting cells that do not express KRASG12C [13]. One important consideration is that\nwe used very high concentrations of Sotorasib in our study and some of the changes in\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n22 of 26\nKRASG12C and KRAS WT interactomes that we see in our screen might not occur at nM\nconcentrations of Sotorasib.\nOur screen helps delineate the mechanism of action of this drug and can explain some\nof the side effects of Sotorasib. With respect to the mechanism of action, the dynamic\nchanges shown in AP-MS conﬁrms that it requires the regulation of the interactions of\nthis mutant with effector proteins, something that was shown already for RAF1 and\nBRAF [37]. As expected, the interaction of these two bona ﬁde effectors is prevented by\nSotorasib treatment in our experiments, and this is accompanied by inhibition of ERK1/2\nphosphorylation. Interestingly, we saw that Sotorasib also promotes the interaction of\nKRASG12C with other known KRAS regulators, such as members of the SRC family,\ni.e., LYN and FYN. With respect to the possible off-target effect of Sotorasib we also\ncharacterized an unexpected modulation of the KRAS WT interactome. These experiments\nindicated that Sotorasib can regulate the interactome of KRAS WT in a way that seems\nsigniﬁcant but needs further investigations.\nAdditionally, we consistently observed a cell-type-speciﬁc increase in activating AKT\nphosphorylation in MEFs and HKe-3, but not HEK293. Activation of AKT upon Sotorasib\ntreatment has been associated with resistance to this treatment in patients and is reported\nin several cell lines [13,57,71,72]. Importantly, our AP-MS approach identiﬁed clear changes\nin the interactomes of both KRAS WT and KRASG12C that potentially can explain the\nSotorasib-induced AKT activation. Candidates for mediating this effect detected in our\nscreen include PIK3R1/2, G-coupled receptor proteins, and ILK, which might contribute\nto the unspeciﬁc activation of AKT in these cells. It is worth noting our analysis shows\nthat some of the changes shown in the interactomes of KRASG12C and KRAS WT upon\nSotorasib treatment can be explained by the direct effect of Sotorasib on some of the proteins\nidentiﬁed which are shown to be targeted by this drug in previous studies (i.e., ACTB, VIM\nor RAN) [14].\nOne important new ﬁnding from our study is the identiﬁcation of a Sotorasib-regulated\ninteraction between KRAS and JAK1 that has not been highlighted before. Reassuringly,\nit must be noted that a recent proteomics screen performed by the Kiel group using a\nsimilar protocol also pulled down JAK1 and STAT3 as speciﬁc interacting proteins of KRAS\nWT, KRASG12C, KRASG12V, and KRASG12D [47]. In our AP-MS proteomics experiment,\nwe see that Sotorasib increases JAK1-KRAS interaction and at the molecular level we\ndemonstrate that Sotorasib causes an inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in HEK293\ncells but not in MEF cells that express only one of the KRAS proteins. This ﬁnding is\nparticularly intriguing as it indicates that JAK1 might be speciﬁcally interacting with\nKRAS bound to GDP and this interaction prevents JAK1-dependent activation of STAT\nsignalling. This new connection between KRAS and JAK-STAT signalling might be of\nclinical relevance as JAK1 inhibition has been shown to reduce murine KRAS mutant\nadenocarcinoma progression [63]. We show that the clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor\nRuxolitinib increases caspase three cleavage in MEF-KRASG12C cells but not in MEF-KRAS\nWT. Remarkably, this experiment led to the unexpected observation that JAK1 inhibition\nalone causes a signiﬁcant increase in expression of both KRAS WT and KRASG12C. Taking\ninto account evidence from clinical trials that show an effect of JAK1 inhibitors in EGFR\nand possible KRAS mutant tumours (NCT02155465, NCT02145637, NCT02917993, and\nNCT03450330) [63], this serendipitous ﬁnding might be of relevance to explain a possible\nmechanism of action of JAK inhibitors in cancer. One possibility is that JAK1 inhibitors,\namong other mechanisms, might induce high levels of mutant KRAS expression that leads\nto the activation of the apoptotic pathways mediated by this RAS isoform [2,73]. It must be\nnoted that this is an acute increase in KRAS expression, which might have very different\neffects than KRAS overexpression caused by gene ampliﬁcation that has been associated\nwith resistance to EGFR and KRAS targeted therapies in colorectal cancer cell lines [72].\nFinally, our study extends the basic knowledge of the known crosstalk between the JAK\nand KRAS pathways. The role of JAK-STAT module in the RAS signalling network seems\nto be at different levels as exempliﬁed by a recent study from Baccarini’s group showing a\nCancers 2023, 15, 4141\n23 of 26\nRAF1 kinase-independent regulation activation of STAT3 signalling in CRC [74]. It would\nbe interesting to test in future studies if Sotorasib can somehow regulate this effect.\n5. Conclusions\nIn summary, this work extends our knowledge about the variety of functional path-\nways that KRAS proteins are mediating and conﬁrms that the interactome of different\nKRAS mutants show important differences. Some of these new ﬁndings might prove\nimportant to explain the differences among KRAS mutant proteins in the promotion of\ncell transformation, tumour development, drug sensitivity, and maintenance of human\ntumours [1,2,4,16]. We also show evidence that performing proteomics screens is important\nto characterise the mechanisms of action of the recent FDA approved RAS targeting drugs\nand the new ones in drug development. Ultimately, determining if a RAS inhibitor prevents\nthe interaction and/or regulation of speciﬁc RAS interactors can predict the mechanism of\nresistance that can hamper the effect of these novel therapies.\nSupplementary Materials:\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at:\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cancers15164141/s1, Figure S1: Speciﬁc protein interaction\nnetwork of KRAS isoforms in HEK293 cells; Figure S2: Speciﬁc interactome network of KRAS isoform\nin HKe-3 cells; Figure S3: AP-MS identify KRAS proteins differential interacting proteins; Figure S4:\nBioinformatic functional analysis of AP-MS data in HEK293 and HKe-3 cells; Figure S5: Functional\nassays shows differential regulation of RADIL by KRAS mutants; Figure S6: Sotorasib regulates of\nKRAS effectors in different cells types; Figure S7: Sotorasib regulates KRAS proteins interactome;\nFigure S8: Network reconstruction of KRASG12C and KRAS WT speciﬁc interactome.

KRAS G12C inhibitors\novercome the “undruggable” challenge, enabling precision therapy. Garsorasib (D-1553), a highly potent and selective KRAS G12C\ninhibitor, has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity and favorable safety proﬁle in early clinical trials. We conducted an open-\nlabel, nonrandomized phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04585035) to assess the safety and efﬁcacy of garsorasib with or without\ncetuximab in KRAS G12C-mutated CRC. In the monotherapy cohort (n = 26), objective response rate (ORR) was 19.2% (95% CI,\n6.6–39.4), disease control rate (DCR) was 92.3% (95% CI, 74.9–99.1), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months (95% CI,\n2.9–11.6) and median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI, 9.5-NE). In the combination cohort (n = 42), ORR was 45.2%\n(95% CI, 29.8–61.3), DCR was 92.9% (95% CI, 80.5–98.5), median PFS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.5–8.1), and median OS was not\nreached. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 5 (19.2%) and 6 (14.3%) patients in monotherapy and combination\ncohort, respectively. Garsorasib with or without cetuximab showed a promising efﬁcacy and manageable safety proﬁles in heavily\npretreated patients with KRAS G12C-mutated CRC, providing a potential new treatment approach for such population.\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2025) 10:189 \n; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-025-02274-z\nINTRODUCTION\nColorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for approximately 10% of all\ncancer cases diagnosed annually, and remains as the second\nleading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1 Metastatic\nprogression occurs in over 50% of CRC patients during their\ndisease course, rendering metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) a\npersistent therapeutic challenge. While highly-selected oligometa-\nstatic cases may achieve durable remission through multidisci-\nplinary interventions including metastasectomy, the majority of\nmCRC patients are incurable.

However,\nKRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations\noccur in approximately 40% of CRC cases and confer resistance to\nanti-EGFR therapy. Clinical outcomes demonstrate marked inter-\nsubtype heterogeneity among different KRAS variants, with\nparticularly unfavorable prognostic implications observed in the\nKRAS G12C subtype. This speciﬁc mutation, present in ~3% of CRC\ncases,2 is associated with signiﬁcantly reduced progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to KRAS wild-\ntype tumors.3–5 The convergence of these poor survival outcomes\nwith\ndemonstrated\nrefractoriness\nto\nconventional\ncytotoxic\ntherapies and anti-EGFR regimens underscores an urgent need\nfor innovative therapeutic strategies.\nKRAS has retained its “undruggable” designation for decades,\nprimarily attributed to two structural challenges.6 Firstly, the KRAS\nprotein exhibits exceptionally high binding afﬁnity for GTP,\ncoupled with the abundant intracellular concentration of GTP,\nrendering the development of competitive inhibitors that effec-\ntively displace GTP-bound KRAS exceedingly challenging. Sec-\nondly, the absence of surface crevices suitable for small-molecule\nengagement deﬁes traditional structure-based drug design para-\ndigms. The era of targeting mutant KRAS was inaugurated in 2013\nthrough seminal work by Ostrem and colleagues,7 which identiﬁed\na druggable allosteric binding pocket adjacent to the switch-II\nregion of the KRAS G12C mutant protein. Crucially, this switch-II\npocket exhibits allele-speciﬁc accessibility—absent in both wild-\ntype KRAS and other KRAS mutants—thereby enabling selective\npharmacological targeting of the KRAS G12C oncoprotein. This\ndiscovery laid the foundation for structure-guided drug develop-\nment, and direct KRAS G12C inhibition has become possible. In\nrecent years, two KRAS G12C inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib,\nhave been approved by the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration (US FDA) for the treatment of patients with locally\nadvanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),8,9 but\nnot in mCRC as monotherapy as to date.\nSo\nfar,\nthe\nreported\nefﬁcacies\nof\nKRAS\nG12C\ninhibitors\nmonotherapy-exempliﬁed by agents such as sotorasib, adagrasib,\nand divarasib-were less impressive in KRAS G12C-mutated CRC\nthan those in NSCLC, with reported objective response rates (ORR)\nranging from 9.7% to 29.1% and median progression-free survival\n(PFS) from 4 to 5.6 months.10–12 This intertumoral disparity\nsuggests the involvement of CRC-speciﬁc resistance mechanisms,\nwhich is potentially driven by compensatory pathway activation. It\nhas been reported that adaptive RAS-MAPK feedback reactivation\noccurred following KRAS G12C inhibition, and this reactivation may\nthus lead to KRAS G12C inhibition resistance.13,14 This adaptive\nfeedback is mainly mediated by EGFR and its downstream\nsignaling pathway in CRC. Accordingly, preclinical and clinical\nevidence suggests that dual targeting of KRAS G12C and EGFR\ncould overcome this resistance mechanism.14 In the KRYSTAL-1\ntrial, an ORR of 34.0% was observed by the combination of\nadagrasib and cetuximab, which achieved a median PFS of\n6.9 months.15 While in the phase III CodeBreaK 300 study, sotorasib\nplus panitumumab achieved a median PFS of 5.6 months and the\nhazard ratio for disease progression or death as compared with the\nstandard-of-care group was 0.48.16 Based on these ﬁndings, FDA\ngranted accelerated approval to adagrasib plus cetuximab on June\n21, 2024, and approval to sotorasib plus panitumumab on January\n16, 2025. However, Asian populations are signiﬁcantly under-\nrepresented in these two approved combination therapies, high-\nlighting unmet clinical needs in this population.\nGarsorasib is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C\nthat selectively and covalently binds to the switch-II pocket of\nKRAS\nG12C\nmutated\nprotein\nin\nits\ninactive\nguanosine\ndiphosphate-bound conformation to inhibit KRAS oncogenic\nsignaling. Garsorasib has shown potent in vitro and in vivo anti-\ntumor activity in preclinical studies with high oral bioavailability\nand distribution to central nervous system tissues.17 Garsorasib\n600 mg twice daily regimen can maintain garsorasib exposure\nabove a target trough concentration throughout 24 hours and\nenable a sustainable inhibition of KRAS-dependent signaling for\nthe duration of the dosing interval, which is predicted to maximize\nanti-tumor activity.18,19 This has been reﬂected in preliminary\nclinical data from garsorasib monotherapy which showed promis-\ning activity across several tumor types in patients with heavily\npretreated KRAS G12C mutated cancer.19–21 As mentioned above,\npreclinical studies have suggested that a KRAS G12C inhibitor in\ncombination with cetuximab, an EGFR-targeted antibody, could\nbe an effective clinical strategy to overcome the resistance.\nTherefore, we conducted an open-label, nonrandomized phase II\ntrial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04585035) to assess the feasibility of\ngarsorasib with or without cetuximab. Here, we present the safety\nand efﬁcacy results from patients with KRAS G12C-mutated\nadvanced or metastatic CRC receiving garsorasib alone or plus\ncetuximab in this trial.\nRESULTS\nPatient disposition and characteristics\nBetween November 23, 2021 and June 29, 2023, a total of 26\npatients with pretreated mCRC harboring KRAS G12C mutation\nwere enrolled and received single-agent garsorasib treatment. The\nmedian duration of treatment was 6.0 months (range, 1.0–21.3),\nand the median follow-up was 13.0 months (range, 1.8–23.3) as\ndata cut-off at February 29, 2024 (Supplementary Table 1). At the\ntime of data cut-off, treatment was discontinued in 24 patients\n(92.3%), most of which were due to disease progression (Fig. 1).\nBetween July 14, 2022 and May 10, 2023, 42 patients with\npretreated mCRC harboring KRAS G12C mutation were enrolled\nand received garsorasib plus cetuximab, with median duration of\ntreatment of 7.7 months (range, 0.9–18.0) and median follow-up\nof 13.0 months (range, 2.3–19.1) as data cut-off at February 29,\n2024 (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 36 (85.7%) patients\ndiscontinued from study treatment, most of which were also due\nto disease progression (Fig. 1). The details of patient disposition\nare shown in Fig. 1.\nDemographic and baseline characteristics are summarized in\nTable 1. In the garsorasib monotherapy cohort, the median age\nwas 61.5 years (range, 44–75), and 38.5% of enrolled patients were\nfemale. In the combination cohort, the median age was 54 years\n(range, 32–76), and 38.1% of enrolled patients were female. The\nmajority of the patients in both cohorts had previously received\nﬂuoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin or irinotecan-based chemotherapy as\nwell as anti-VEGF therapy, with a median number of three prior\nlines of systematic therapy.\nEfﬁcacy\nAs of February 29, 2024, among 26 patients who were treated with\nsingle-agent garsorasib, one patient achieved complete response\n(CR), 4 achieved partial response (PR) and 19 had stable disease\n(SD) (Table 2; Fig. 2a). The conﬁrmed ORR and disease control rate\n(DCR) were 19.2% (95% CI, 6.6–39.4) and 92.3% (95% CI,\n74.9–99.1), respectively (Table 2). The median time to response\nand median duration of response were 2.6 months (range,\n1.4–5.5), and 10.3 months (95% CI, 2.7–not estimated [NE]),\nrespectively (Fig. 2b; Table 2). The median PFS was 5.5 months\n(95% CI, 2.9–11.6) (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Table 2). The Kaplan-\nMeier estimates of PFS were 49.7% (95% CI, 29.5–67.0) at\n6 months, 45.2% (95% CI, 25.5–63.0) at 9 months, and 31.0%\n(95% CI, 13.9–49.9) at 12 months (Supplementary Table 2). The\nmedian OS was 13.1 months (95% CI, 9.5-NE) (Supplementary\nTable 3). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS were 96.0% (95% CI,\n74.8–99.4) at 6 months, 83.6% (95% CI, 62.0–93.5) at 9 months and\n58.0% (95% CI, 35.9–74.8) at 12 months (Supplementary Table 3).\nGarsorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, with or without cetuximab, an EGFR. . .\nRuan et al.\n2\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2025) 10:189 \nIn the combination therapy cohort, of the 42 patients who\nreceived garsorasib plus cetuximab, one patient achieved CR, 18\nachieved PR and 20 had SD (Table 2; Fig. 3a), with a conﬁrmed\nORR and DCR of 45.2% (95% CI, 29.8–61.3) and 92.9% (95% CI,\n80.5–98.5), respectively. The median time to response and median\nduration of response were 1.7 months (range, 1.2–13.8), and\n8.2 months (95% CI, 4.2-NE), respectively (Fig. 3b; Table 2). The\nmedian\nPFS\nwas\n7.5\nmonths\n(95%\nCI,\n5.5–8.1)\n(Fig.\n3c;\nSupplementary Table 2). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS were\n55.0% (95% CI, 38.5–68.8) at 6 months, 33.4% (95% CI, 19.2–48.3)\nat 9 months and 30.6% (95% CI, 16.9–45.5) at 12 months\n(Supplementary Table 2). The median OS was not reached (95%\nCI, 11.3-NE) as data cut-off (Supplementary Table 3). The Kaplan-\nMeier estimates of OS at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months were\n92.7% (95% CI, 79.0–97.6), 82.5% (95% CI, 66.7–91.3), and 67.5%\n(95% CI, 49.7–80.2), respectively (Supplementary Table 3).\nExploratory subgroup analyses for ORR across key clinical\nsubgroups both in monotherapy and combination therapy\ncohorts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary\nFig. 2, respectively.

The full list of TRAEs of any grade is\nprovided in the Supplementary Table 5. TRAEs of grade 3 or 4\noccurred in 6 (14.3%) patients, including rash, dermatitis acnei-\nform, increased bilirubin conjugated, hypomagnesaemia and\npruritic rash. No Grade 5 TRAEs were reported. TRAEs led to\ngarsorasib dose reduction or interruption in 4 (9.5%) patients.\nNo patient reported discontinuation of garsorasib due to TRAEs.\nTRAEs led to cetuximab dose reduction or interruption in 11\n(26.2%) patients, and cetuximab discontinuation in one (2.4%)\npatient (Table 3).\nIn the monotherapy cohort, TRAE of blood bilirubin increased\n(11.5%), bilirubin conjugated increased (7.7%) and hyperbilirubi-\nnaemia (3.8%) were commonly observed, and TRAE of blood\nbilirubin increased (21.4%), bilirubin conjugated increased (9.5%)\nand blood bilirubin unconjugated increased (2.4%) were also\ncommonly observed in the combination treatment cohort. Most of\nthese adverse events were grade 1-2 with only one grade 3\nhyperbilirubinaemia\nand\none\ngrade\n3\nbilirubin\nconjugated\nincreased in monotherapy cohort and combination cohort,\nrespectively. These events were resolved with garsorasib dose\ninterruption and did not lead to garsorasib dose reduction or\npermanent discontinuation. No Hy’s law cases were reported.\nDISCUSSION\nApproximately 2–4% of mCRC patients harbor the KRAS G12C\nmutation,3,12,22,23\nFDA\ngranted\napproval\nto\nadagrasib\nplus\ncetuximab and sotorasib plus panitumumab only recently and\nthere is still a great unmet need for such patients who have a\ndismal prognosis. In this study, garsorasib was evaluated as a\nsingle agent and in combination with cetuximab in non-parallel\nand non-randomized cohorts of heavily pretreated KRAS G12C-\nmutated mCRC patients. The combination of garsorasib and\ncetuximab\ndemonstrated\nhigher\nORR\nand\na\ntrend\ntoward\nimproved PFS and OS compared with garsorasib alone, suggesting\npotential synergistic effect between a KRAS inhibitor and an anti-\nEGFR antibody. This ﬁnding is consistent with the discoveries\nmade in preclinical studies13,14,24 and the observations from\nclinical studies involving drugs of the same class.15,16\nIn the present study, no unmanageable safety concerns were\nidentiﬁed in either cohort. In the monotherapy cohort, the most\ncommon TRAEs were liver function abnormalities and gastro-\nintestinal events, which were reversible and manageable with\ndose interruption and supportive medication. The incidence and\nseverity observed in the monotherapy cohort were generally\nconsistent with those observed in a pooled analysis of the safety\nof garsorasib among 306 patients for the purpose of marketing\napproval in China (refer to garsorasib label in China for details).\nThese events were clinically manageable and resolved with\ngarsorasib dose interruption and/or reduction and usually did\nnot lead to treatment discontinuation. On the other hand, TRAE of\nblood bilirubin increased was reported in 11.5% and 21.4% of\npatients in garsorasib monotherapy and combination therapy\ncohorts, respectively. However, most of these adverse events were\ngrade 1–2 with only one grade 3 event in each cohort, and no Hy’s\nlaw cases were reported. There is also no trend of dose-related\nhepatotoxicity in the dose escalation study of garsorasib.18\nBesides, TRAE of increased blood bilirubin was also commonly\nobserved in some of the other KRAS G12C inhibitors such as JAB-\n21822 and IBI351,25–27 indicating that it might not be a\ncoincidence but a common phenomenon. In terms of gastro-\nintestinal adverse effects frequently observed in other KRAS G12C\ninhibitors,11,12,28 the incidence was generally lower in garsorasib\n(diarrhea at 11.5%, nausea at 7.7%, and no vomiting reported),\ncompared to those reported of other KRAS G12C inhibitors\n(diarrhea at 31.7–69%, nausea at 19–78%, and vomiting at\n7.9–58%). This phenomenon was also evidenced by the safety\ndata reported in two studies evaluating garsorasib monotherapy\nin\nadvanced\nNSCLC\npatients,\nin\nwhich\nthe\nincidences\nof\ngastrointestinal adverse effects, including nausea, diarrhea and\nvomiting, were around 20%.19,29\nIn the combination cohort, the safety proﬁle was generally\nmanageable and consistent with those reported for each drug\nalone. There were also no observed synergistic toxic effects in the\ncombination cohort. Dose modiﬁcation and discontinuation were\nmainly attributed to cetuximab (26.2% and 2.4%, respectively). No\npatients in this cohort discontinued treatment due to garsorasib-\nrelated adverse events. Interestingly, the incidence of grade 3-4\nTRAE (14.3%) in the combination cohort was numerically lower\nthan that (19.2%) in the monotherapy cohort. Similar results were\nobserved in the KRYSTAL-1\nstudy\nevaluating adagrasib\nas\nmonotherapy or in combination with cetuximab in the same\npopulaton.21 TRAEs of grade 3–4 occurred in 34.1% (15/44) of\npatients who received adagrasib monotherapy, whereas they\ndeclined to 15.6% (5/32) in patients who received adagrasib plus\ncetuximab. Further studies are warranted to uncover the under-\nlying mechanisms.\nBoth in the monotherapy and combination cohorts, the\nmajority of patients (92.3% and 85.2%) had received at least\ntwo prior lines of systematic therapy, and 84.6% and 92.9% of\nthem were pretreated with anti-VEGF therapy, respectively.\nNevertheless, single-agent garsorasib and the combination of\nTable 3.\nTRAEs summary\nMonotherapy cohort\n(n = 26)\nTRAE Summary, n (%)\nTRAEs of any grade\n14 (53.8)\nGrade 3-4 TRAEs\n5 (19.2)\nLeading to Dose Reduction or Interruption 5 (19.2)\nLeading to Drug Discontinuation\n1 (3.8)\nLeading to Death\n0\nMost Common (≥10%) TRAEs, n (%)\nAny Grade Grade 3-4\nAlanine aminotransferase increased\n8 (30.8)\n3 (11.5)\nAspartate aminotransferase increased\n7 (26.9)\n2 (7.7)\nDiarrhea\n3 (11.5)\n1 (3.8)\nBlood bilirubin increased\n3 (11.5)\n0\nCombination cohort\n(n = 42)\nTRAE Summary, n (%)\nGarsorasib Cetuximab\nTRAEs of any grade\n42 (100)\nGrade 3-4 TRAEs\n6 (14.3)\nLeading to Dose Reduction or Interruption 4 (9.5)\n11 (26.2)\nLeading to Drug Discontinuation\n0\n1 (2.4)\nLeading to Death\n0\n0\nMost Common (≥10%) TRAEs, n (%)\nAny Grade Grade 3-4\nRash\n30 (71.4)\n2 (4.8)\nAspartate aminotransferase increased\n15 (35.7)\n0\nParonychia\n14 (33.3)\n0\nAlanine aminotransferase increased\n13 (31.0)\n0\nBlood bilirubin increased\n9 (21.4)\n0\nDry skin\n7 (16.7)\n0\nProteinuria\n6 (14.3)\n0\nSkin ﬁssures\n6 (14.3)\n0\nDermatitis acneiform\n5 (11.9)\n1 (2.4)\nNausea\n5 (11.9)\n0\nPruritus\n5 (11.9)\n0\nGarsorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, with or without cetuximab, an EGFR. . .\nRuan et al.\n6\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2025) 10:189 \ngarsorasib and cetuximab achieved considerable ORRs of 19.2%\nand 45.2%, and a trend toward prolonged PFS and OS, as\ncompared with the standard-of-care includes regorafenib and\ntriﬂuridine/tipiracil, which demonstrated an ORR of 1.0% and\n1.6%, respectively.30,31 Similar results were observed in other\nstudies investigating KRAS G12C inhibitors, such as adagrasib,16\nsotorasib,11 and divarasib,32 as monotherapy and combination\ntherapy. Therefore, garsorasib is worthy of further investigation in\nphase III trial against standard-of-care therapy, especially in\ncombination with cetuximab.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be acknowledged.\nFirstly, the nonrandomized design does not allow for direct\ncomparisons between garsorasib monotherapy/combination and\nstandard-of-care, but garsorasib with or without cetuximab indeed\ndemonstrated promising anti-tumor activity as later-line therapy\nfor\nthese\nmCRC\nsubsets\ncompared\nwith\nhistorical\ncontrol.\nSecondly, the sample size was relatively small in this study, and\nrandomized clinical trials with large sample size are needed to\nconﬁrm the ﬁndings. Thirdly, the present follow-up time was not\nenough\nto\ncapture\nthe\nlong-term\nsurvival\nbeneﬁt\nof\nthe\ncombination cohort. Since promising anti-tumor activity was\nindicated by considerably enhanced ORR and PFS in the present\nstudy, further investigation of garsorasib plus cetuximab is needed\nto conﬁrm its survival beneﬁt in large sample study with long term\nfollow-up.\nIn conclusion, favorable safety proﬁle and promising anti-\ntumor activity were observed in both the garsorasib mono-\ntherapy and combination cohorts. Most importantly, this is the\nﬁrst study reporting the highest proportion of Asian patients\nwith mCRC receiving a KRAS G12C inhibitor as to date, which\nprovides further evidence supporting the generalizability of\nKRAS G12C inhibitors in such population. Conﬁrmatory rando-\nmized phase III studies with large sample size are planned to\nfurther evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of garsorasib in\ncombination with cetuximab versus standard-of-care as the\nlater-line treatment in this population.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy design\nWe conducted a multicenter, phase I/II, open-label study to\nevaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of single-agent garsorasib and in\ncombination with other anti-tumor therapies in patients with\nadvanced\nor\nmetastatic\nKRAS\nG12C-mutated\nsolid\ntumors,\nincluding CRC (refer to protocol for detailed study design). Phase\nI study comprised of two parts: monotherapy dose escalation\n(phase Ia from 150 mg to 1600 mg) and dose combination (phase\nIb). The RP2D was determined to be 600 mg twice daily (BID)\nbased on the results from phase Ia study,18 and was used in phase\nII stage of this study. The phase II portion is a six-arm, non-parallel,\nopen-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the efﬁcacy of\ngarsorasib as single agent and in combination in patients with\nadvanced or metastatic solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation.\nAmong them, Arm B enrolled patients with KRAS G12C mutated\nadvanced solid tumors (including CRC) other than NSCLC and\nwere treated with garsorasib at RP2D; Arm F only enrolled patients\nwith CRC and were treated with garsorasib plus cetuximab. Here,\nwe report the efﬁcacy and safety results from patients with KRAS\nG12C-mutated advanced or metastatic CRC receiving garsorasib\nwith or without cetuximab, which consist of a subgroup of CRC\npatients from Arm B and the whole Arm F in the phase II study. A\ntotal of 24 study centers from China, the United States, Australia,\nand South Korea contributed to the CRC patient enrollment\n(Supplementary Table 6). In the garsorasib monotherapy cohort,\nall 26 patients were from Arm B. In the garsorasib combination\ncohort, all 42 patients were from Arm F.\nThe protocol amendments related to the two cohorts in this\nstudy are as follows: 1) To include garsorasib in combination with\ncetuximab in dose expansion (phase II), and to reﬁne the study\nprocedures, such as ECG test, PK sample time points (version 1.3 to\nversion 2.0); 2) Based on accumulated preliminary efﬁcacy data in\nmCRC, anti-tumor activities were expected in phase II Arm B and\nArm F, thus the previous assumptions of Simon 2 stage design in\nArm B and Arm F were no longer applicable. The design of these\ntwo arms was converted into a simple expansion cohort design\nand the sample sizes of these arms were adjusted accordingly\n(version 2.0 to version 3.0).\nThis study adhered to Good Clinical Practice guidelines (as\ndeﬁned by the International Council on Harmonisation) and\nprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was\napproved by the independent ethics committee or institutional\nreview board at each participating site. Written informed consent\nwas obtained from all patients before screening. This study was\nregistered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04585035.\nParticipants\nPatients (≥18 years of age) with histologically or cytologically\nconﬁrmed advanced or metastatic CRC harboring KRAS G12C\nmutation (conﬁrmed by historical local lab results within 5 years\nprior to treatment, as well as by central lab for phase II), were\neligible for this study. Patients receiving garsorasib alone must be\nrefractory to or intolerant of existing standard treatment, and\npatients\nreceiving\ngarsorasib\nplus\ncetuximab\nshould\nhave\nprogressed after at least one available standard therapy. Patients\nwho\nhad\nunstable\nor\nprogressive\ncentral\nnervous\nsystem\nmetastases, prior treatment of KRAS G12C inhibitors, or anti-\nEGFR\ntherapy\n(only\nfor\npatients\nreceiving\ngarsorasib\nplus\ncetuximab) were excluded.\nProcedures\nPatients with advanced or metastatic CRC in the monotherapy\ncohort received oral garsorasib at RP2D (600 mg BID) in a fasting\nstate. In the combination cohort, patients were treated with oral\ngarsorasib 600 mg BID in combination with intravenous cetuximab\nat an initial dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface area\n(mg/m2) on day 1 of cycle 1 and 250 mg/m2 weekly thereafter.\nEach 21-day period was considered as one treatment cycle.\nTreatment continued until disease progression, withdrawal of\nconsent, unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation from the study\nfor other reasons.\nAdverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National\nCancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\n(NCI CTCAE) version 5.0. AEs were collected from the time the\npatient provided written informed consent until the end of safety\nfollow-up (30 calendar days after the last dose of study treatment\nor until start of new anti-tumor therapy).\nOutcomes\nThe primary endpoint was ORR. Secondary endpoints included\nDCR, PFS, DOR, and OS, as well as type, incidence, severity, and\nattribution of AEs. The ORR, DCR, PFS and DOR were evaluated by\nthe investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid\nTumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\nSample size considerations\nAlthough there was no formal statistical hypothesis prespeciﬁed,\nsample size estimation was performed to determine the sample\nsize when we conducted this trial. The consideration of sample\nsize was provided as follows:\nMonotherapy cohort: the ORR of third-line standard-of care\n(SOC) treatment in mCRC is less than 5%. Assuming the ORR of\ngarsorasib monotherapy is around 20%, 26 subjects will provide\nmore than 80% power to assure that the ORR of garsorasib\nmonotherapy is greater than 5%.\nCombination cohort: Assuming the ORR of garsorasib in\ncombination with cetuximab is around 40%, 42 subjects will\nGarsorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, with or without cetuximab, an EGFR. . .\nRuan et al.\n7\nSignal Transduction and Targeted Therapy  (2025) 10:189 \nprovide more than 80% power to assure that the ORR of\ngarsorasib in combination with cetuximab is greater than 20%.\nStatistical analysis\nThe efﬁcacy analyses in this study were performed following ITT\nprinciple.\nAll\nthe\nsubjects\nreceived\nat\nleast\none\ndose\nof\ninvestigational drug, no matter with or without post baseline\ntumor assessments, were included in the analysis set for efﬁcacy\nanalysis and safety analysis as the whole population. The protocol\ndeﬁned this population as the safety analysis set but it is indeed\nthe same as the ITT population. Statistical Analysis System version\n9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to analyze the efﬁcacy\noutcomes. ORR, DCR and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were\ncalculated using Clopper-Pearson method. PFS, OS and DOR were\nanalyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe datasets (including de-identiﬁed individual data) generated during the current\nstudy are available from the corresponding author upon request by contacting\nxurh@sysucc.org.cn, not for commercial use.

One of the most \nprevalent mutations, G12C, has led to the clinical approval of targeted inhibitors for advanced stages in lung cancer. \nResearch has increasingly focused on the efficacy of combination therapies that target multiple tumorigenic \npathways. Cases harboring KRAS G12C mutation are heterogenous. We explored alternative changes in genetic \npathways and evaluated the effectiveness of combination therapy using several types of cell lines and KRAS inhibitors.\nMethods  We comprehensively investigated genetic changes induced by KRAS G12C inhibition using RNA sequences \nand the candidate to inhibit in combination therapy was explored. Three lung cancer cell lines (two adenocarcinoma \nand one squamous cell carcinoma) and three KRAS G12C inhibitors (AMG 510, MRTX849, and ARS-1620) were used. \nKRAS G12C and candidate gene were simultaneously inhibited in cell lines and the efficiency of combination therapy \nwas evaluated using clonogenic assays and MTS assay. Pathway activation was assessed via western blotting. A \ncombination index (CI) < 0.8 was considered statistically synergistic.\nResults  RNA sequences revealed treatment with two of the three KRAS G12C inhibitors led to a significant increase in \nmTOR expression across all three cell lines. mTOR was targeted in combination therapy; each KRAS G12C inhibitor and \nmTOR inhibitor (RAD001) combination exhibited synergism (CI < 0.8) in MTS and clonogenic assays. Single inhibition \nof mTOR induced activation of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-RAS, thereby activating the RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-\nmTOR pathways in WB, suggesting mTOR activation is crucial for KRAS-driving lung cancer. A combination strategy \ntargeting KRAS G12C and mTOR abrogated GTP-RAS, pmTOR (Ser2448), and pERK (Thr202/Tyr204) more efficiently.\nConclusions  KRAS G12C inhibitor plus RAD001 consistently revealed synergism. Targeting KRAS G12C and mTOR \nabrogates the RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. Our data suggests that a combined strategy targeting GTP-\nbound KRAS G12C and mTOR shows promise for primary lung cancers with KRAS G12C mutations. This approach may \nalso be effective even for lung cancers harboring KRAS G12C mutation but having different profiles.\nDual inhibition of GTP-bound KRAS and mTOR \nin lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma harboring KRAS G12C\nMasaoki Ito1,2*\n, Yoshihiro Miyata1*, Shoko Hirano3, Nagisa Morihara3, Misako Takemoto3, Fumiko Irisuna3, \nKei Kushitani4, Kenichi Suda2, Junichi Soh2,5, Yukio Takeshima4, Yasuhiro Tsutani2 and Morihito Okada1\nPage 2 of 11\nIto et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2025) 23:220 \nBackground\nKirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) is a major onco-driving gene \nin lung cancer. Somatic KRAS mutations are likely har­\nbored in lung adenocarcinoma patients with a history of \nsmoking [1] and can also be harbored in squamous cell \ncarcinoma patients [2]. Targeting inhibitors for KRAS \nG12C have been clinically approved for advanced cases \n[3].\nIn gene target therapies, acquired resistance is inevita­\nble and its mechanisms have been revealed in treatment \ntargeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) muta­\ntions and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrange­\nments [4–7]. Likewise, resistant mechanisms in other \ntarget therapies, secondary nucleotide changes have \nbeen reported in KRAS G12C inhibition [8, 9]. Activa­\ntions of alternative or downstream pathways have been \nalso revealed as a resistant mechanism in KRAS-driving \ntumors. Clinical data and in vitro studies have unveiled \nthat secondary mutations in KRAS or amplification in \nMET can emerge as resistant mechanisms for KRAS \nG12C inhibitors [8, 9]. Other studies showed that KRAS \nsignaling can be maintained after KRAS G12C inhibi­\ntion and then drug-resistance is acquired by EGFR or \nAURKA signaling [10], or epithelial-mesenchymal tran­\nsition (EMT) via PI3K pathway activation [11]. KRAS-\nmutant cases are heterogeneous. EMT is also one of the \nkey mechanisms for acquired resistance [12, 13]. Differ­\nent tumorigenesis is suggested between epithelial and \nmesenchymal types [14]. KRAS inhibition alone can be \nthwarted by compensatory or parallel pathway activa­\ntion [15, 16] and monotherapy may be an insufficient \napproach.\nTo overcome the resistance or achieve greater efficiency \nof target therapy, the usefulness of combination therapies \ntargeting several signaling pathways has been suggested \n[17–20]. Co-inhibition by KRAS G12C plus SHP2 [21] or \nKRAS G12C plus mTORC1 kinase has been suggested to \nbe promising [22]. Solanki et al. evaluated combination \ntherapy by dividing KRAS-mutant cases into epithelial \nand mesenchymal types; the former is activated by IGFRs \nand ERBB2/3 and responsive to co-inhibition with SHP2 \nor SOS1, and the latter is activated by IRAS1 or AXL sig­\nnaling [14]. Combination treatment for tumors harboring \nKRAS G12C is a promising approach and is not limited to \nlung cancer [23, 24].\nCombination strategies have been attempted to con­\nquer the KRAS-driving tumors [15, 25, 26]. Phase II-\nIII clinical trials of the combination of the KRAS G12C \ninhibitor with cytotoxic chemotherapy or immune check­\npoint inhibitors (ICIs) for non-small cell lung cancer \n(NSCLC) are ongoing (NCT05920356, NCT04613596, \nNCT05472623, \nNCT05609578, \nNCT05375994, \nNCT05840510, \nNCT05578092, \nNCT06024174, \nNCT05118854, NCT05054725, NCT05074810) [27].\nWe aimed to reveal the alternative pathway changes as \na potential mechanism of resistance using several types \nof KRAS-mutant cell lines (adenocarcinoma or squamous \ncell carcinoma, epithelial or mesenchymal type, or onco­\ngenic mutations in STK11 and/or TP53) and evaluate the \nefficiency of combination therapy targeting the alterna­\ntive pathway change.\nMethods\nOverview of study design\nWe aimed to evaluate alternative changes in the tumori­\ngenesis pathway induced by KRAS target treatment. \nThree lung cancer cell lines (including squamous cell \ncarcinoma) harboring KRAS G12C were cultured with \nthree types of KRAS G12C inhibitors, and the frequency \nof KRAS G12C was explored in clinical adenocarcinoma \nand squamous cell carcinoma patients. After exposure \nto each inhibitor, RNA-Seq was performed and changes \nin the mRNA expression of tumor-related genes were \nevaluated. The candidates detected by RNA-Seq were \nfurther examined to determine whether their inhibition \nwas effective in KRAS-targeted therapy. The efficiency \nof combination therapy for KRAS G12C was also deter­\nmined. All the procedures involving human participants \nwere in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration \nand its later amendments or comparable ethical stan­\ndards. Informed consent for collecting samples for use \nin the study and publication of results was obtained from \nall patients before surgery. This study was approved by \nthe Institutional Review Board of Hiroshima University \n(E2020-2081-01).\nDetection of KRAS G12C in clinical primary lung cancer \ncases\nThe frequency of KRAS G12C was evaluated in con­\nsecutive patients with pN0M0 adenocarcinoma and \nsquamous cell carcinoma resected at Hiroshima Univer­\nsity Hospital between 2007 and 2019 or 2014 and 2018. \nDNA was extracted from the resected frozen or forma­\nlin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using the QIAamp \nDNA Micro Kit or the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit \n(56304, 56404; Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). KRAS \nG12C was detected using commercially available primers \nand probes (1863506; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and \nQX100 Droplet Digital PCR System (1863111, Bio-Rad, \nKeywords  KRAS G12C, mTOR, Combination therapy, Lung adenocarcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma, Sotorasib, \nAdagrasib, AMG 510, MRTX 849, ARS-1620\nPage 3 of 11\nIto et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2025) 23:220 \nHercules, CA, USA). The detailed ddPCR conditions \nhave been described previously [28].\nCell lines and inhibitors\nThree lung cancer cell lines harboring KRAS G12C \nwere used: H23 (adenocarcinoma), HOP-62 (adenocar­\ncinoma), and Calu-1 (squamous cell carcinoma). As a \ncontrol, H520 cells (KRAS wild type, lung squamous cell \ncarcinoma) were used in the clonogenic assay. RPMI 1640 \nMedia (11875093, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) \nand McCoy’s 5 A (Modified) Medium (16600082, Thermo \nFisher Scientific, MA, USA) medium supplemented with \n10% fetal bovine serum and 50  µg/mL penicillin-strep­\ntomycin were used for H23/HOP-62/H520 and Calu-1, \nrespectively. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmo­\nsphere with 5% CO2 at 37ºC. AMG 510, MRTX849, and \nARS-1620 were used as KRAS G12C inhibitors, while \nRAD001 was used as a mammalian target of rapamycin \n(mTOR) inhibitor. The profiles of each cell line are shown \nin Additional file 1: Supplementary Table 1. Information \non the inhibitors is provided in Additional file 2: Supple­\nmentary Table 2.\nRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with next-generation \nsequencing (NGS)\nTo evaluate changes in mRNA expression levels, we \nperformed RNA-Seq using cell lines treated with KRAS \nG12C inhibitors. Cells (50,000) were disseminated in \na 60  mm dish (83.3901; SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Ger­\nmany). The cells were cultured for 24 h to attach, and the \nmedium was replaced with a fresh medium containing \na KRAS G12C inhibitor or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). \nThe number of seeded cells and the concentration of \ninhibitors were the same regardless of the cell line. The \nmedium containing the inhibitor or DMSO was changed \nevery 3 d for approximately 14 d before reaching cell \nconfluency. RNA was extracted using the Tri Reagent \n(TR118, COSMO BIO. Tokyo, Japan).\nFor cDNA synthesis, we used PrimeScript™ Double \nStrand cDNA Synthesis Kit (6111 A, TAKARA BIO INC., \nKusatsu, Siga, Japan) to make cDNA from the mRNA \npurified with Oligotex™-dT30 < Super > mRNA Purifica­\ntion Kit (9086, TAKARA BIO INC., Kusatsu, Siga, Japan). \nFor library preparation, 14 ng of covaris sheared cDNA \nwas used as a direct input for the xGen Prism DNA \nLibrary Prep Kit (10006202, Integrated DNA Technolo­\ngies Inc., Coralville, IA, USA) and indexed by xGen UDI \nPrimer Pairs, Index 1–96 (Integrated DNA Technolo­\ngies Inc., Coralville, IA, USA). Libraries were pooled at \n500 ng each and subsequently hybridized with the xGen \nHybridization and Wash Kit (1080577, Integrated DNA \nTechnologies Inc., Coralville, IA, USA) and xGen Cus­\ntoms Hyb Panels (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., \nCoralville, IA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s \ninstructions. The final captured libraries were quantified \nusing a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Thermo \nFisher Scientific, MA, USA) and a Bioanalyzer High Sen­\nsitivity DNA Analysis Kit (5067 − 4626, Agilent Technolo­\ngies, Santa Clara, CA USA). The expression levels of 48 \noncogenes and beta-actin were assessed. The genes eval­\nuated are listed in Additional file 3: Supplementary Table \n3. We pooled six capture pools together at 4 nM and \nsequenced them on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, PE Rapid v2 \nworkflow) with 2 × 67 bp paired-end reads.\nReal-time PCR\nmRNA expression levels were examined using real-time \nPCR and performed independently of RNA sequenc­\ning. Predesigned primers and probes (TaqMan Gene \nExpression Assays, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) \nwere used for mTOR (Hs00234508_m1) and β-actin \nwas used as an internal control (Hs01060665_g1). RNA \nwas extracted as described above and purified using \nthe SuperScript IV VIL Master Mix with ezDNase \n(11766050, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Real-\ntime PCR was performed using StepOnePlus (Thermo \nFisher Scientific, MA, USA). Delta-delta cycle threshold \n(Ct) was employed to quantify expression level using the \nfollowing formula; 2−(DCt sample), in which delta Ct (DCt) \nvalues were determined by subtracting the Ct value of \nthe house-keeping gene (β-actin) from the Ct value of the \ntarget gene.\nClonogenic assay\nClonogenic assays were performed as previously \ndescribed [15]. Briefly, 300 cells were seeded in 6-well \nplates (83.3920, SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany). \nThe cells were cultured for 24  h and the medium was \nreplaced with inhibitor(s) or DMSO. The number of \nseeded cells and the concentration of inhibitors were the \nsame regardless of the cell line. The medium containing \ninhibitor(s) or DMSO was changed every 3 d for 11–14 \nd before reaching cell confluency. The medium was \nremoved, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buff­\nered saline (PBS). The colonies were fixed with metha­\nnol for 25 min on ice and stained with 0.5% crystal violet \n(031-04852, Wako, Japan) for 15 min at room tempera­\nture. The colonies were then washed and photographed. \nFor semiquantitative measurements, the crystal violet \nwas reabsorbed using 2% SDS, and the absorbance was \nmeasured at 570 nm using a TriStar LB941 (BERTHOLD, \nTokyo, Japan).\nMTS assay\nThe antitumor effect of the drug combination was \nassessed by cell viability using the Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazo­\nlium Bromide assay and the drug concentration required \nfor 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was determined using \nPage 4 of 11\nIto et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2025) 23:220 \nGraphPad Prism Version 7.05 (GraphPad Software, San \nDiego, CA, USA). Tumor cells were seeded at a den­\nsity of 2000 (H23) or 3000 (Calu-1) per well in 96-well \nplates (83.3924; SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) and \nallowed to attach for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were \ntreated with a medium containing several inhibitor(s) \nfor 3 d. After treatment, the cells were incubated with a \nmedium containing reagent for MTS assay (G3581, Pro­\nmega) for 2 h at 37ºC. Cell viability was determined by \nmeasuring the absorbance at 450  nm using Multiskan \nGO (N10588, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). To \nevaluate the combination index (CI), the concentration of \neach inhibitor ranged from 2− 6 and 22 IC50. The average \nof the CIs from each concentration (from 2− 6 to 21 IC50) \nwas used as the final CI.\nWestern blotting\nCells (35 × 104) were seeded in 35  mm dishes (83.3900, \nSARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) with medium and \nallowed to attach for 24  h. The medium was replaced \nwith fresh medium with or without the inhibitor(s). \nAfter 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS \nand lysed in RIPA buffer (9806, Cell Signaling Technol­\nogy, Danvers, MA, USA) containing protease inhibi­\ntor (04080-24, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and PMSF \n(8553, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). \nFollowing centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4ºC, \nthe supernatant was collected as the total cell lysate and \nthen diluted using the Laemmli Sample Buffer (1610737, \nBIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) and 2-mercaptoethanol \n(161–0710, BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). After heating \nfor 5  min at 95ºC, the lysates containing proteins were \nelectrophoresed on 5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel elec­\ntrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride \nmembranes (1704156, BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). \nAll target proteins were immunoblotted with the appro­\npriate primary and secondary antibodies using the Can \nGet Signal/PVDF Blocking Reagent (NKB101/NYPBR; \nTOYOBO LIFE SCIENCE, Tokyo, Japan). β-actin was \nused as an internal control. Chemiluminescent bands \nwere detected, and expression levels were measured \nusing an Amersham Imager 680 (General Electric, CT, \nUSA). The protein expression levels were quantified \nusing ImageQuant TL (Cytiva, Tokyo, Japan). The anti­\nbodies and their concentrations are listed in Additional \nfile 2: Supplementary Table 2. The GTP-binding RAS was \nextracted and detected using an Active RAS Pull-Down \nand Detection Kit (16117, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, \nUSA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To detect \nanother protein in the same membrane, the attached \nantibody was removed using the Stripping Solution (193-\n16375, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, \nOsaka, Japan).\nGeneration and transfection of mTOR-targeting SiRNA\nsiRNA targeting mTOR was generated using Silencer \nSelect Validated siRNA (4427038, Thermo Fisher Sci­\nentific, MA, USA). siRNAs designed to block mTOR \nexpression (4390824, siRNA ID s603/s604, Thermo \nFisher Scientific, MA, USA) or Silencer Select Negative \nControl (4390843, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) \nwas transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent \n(3778-030, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). After \nincubation of cell lines with siRNA for 72  h, the cells \nwere seeded in 96-well plates (83.3924; SARSTEDT, \nNümbrecht, Germany). The MTS assay was performed \nas described above, and the effect of silencing mTOR in \nKRAS G12C cell lines was evaluated.\nData analysis\nThe reads resulting from the capture of 49 genes were \nsubjected to RNA-seq analysis using the StrandNGS soft­\nware, version 2.7 (Tomy Digital Biology). The reads were \naligned against a human genome reference (hg19) using \nRefSeq transcript annotations. Low-quality read removal \nand QC were then performed, and quantification was \nperformed using the DEseq algorithm. The impact of \ncombination therapy was evaluated using the CI calcu­\nlated using the Chou–Talalay method [29]. Data for CI \ncalculation was referred to in quantified cell viability in \nthe MTS assay or concentration of crystal violet in the \nClonogenic assay. A combination index of less than 0.8 \nwas regarded as statistically synergistic. The significance \nof the frequency was evaluated using the chi-squared or \nYates chi-squared test. Protein and mRNA expression \nlevels were compared using the multiple T test or Mann–\nWhitney U test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. \nStatistical analyses and figure creation were performed \nusing SPSS Version 29.0.1.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, \nUSA), StatMate V (ATMS Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and \nGraphPad Prism Version 7.05 (GraphPad Software, San \nDiego, CA, USA).\nResults\nDistribution of KRAS G12C in lung adenocarcinoma and \nsquamous cell carcinoma\nWe tested KRAS mutations using ddPCR in 877 resected \nadenocarcinoma and 113 squamous cell carcinoma \nsamples. KRAS G12C was detected in 2.9% (25/877) and \n1.8% (2/113) of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell car­\ncinoma, respectively. Among KRAS G12C cases, 85.2% \n(23/27), including two squamous cell carcinoma cases, \nwere current or ex-smokers.\nmRNA expression change induced by KRAS G12C \nInhibition\nRNA-Seq NGS revealed increasing or decreasing \nchanges in mRNA expression. The results are presented \nPage 5 of 11\nIto et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2025) 23:220 \nas volcano plots in Fig.  1A. The expression of four, 17, \nand 11 genes was significantly increased by AMG 510, \nMRTX849, and ARS-1620 treatment, respectively. The \nexpression level of mTOR was significantly increased \nin all three cell lines by two of the three inhibitors (H23 \ntreated with MRTX849 and ARS-1620, HOP-62 treated \nwith AMG 510 and MRTX849, and Calu-1 treated with \nAMG 510 and ARS-1620) (Fig. 1B). Although the expres­\nsion of mTOR in H23 cells after AMG 510 treatment did \nnot significantly increase by NGS, a significant increase \nin mTOR RNA expression after AMG 510 treatment was \nconfirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C). RNA-Seq revealed \nthat the increased expression of mTOR was induced by \nseveral KRAS G12C inhibitors.\nSynergism of KRAS G12C inhibitors and mTOR inhibitor\nA clonogenic assay revealed synergism between each \nKRAS G12C and mTOR inhibitor (RAD001). The col­\nony formation was suppressed in a dose-dependent \nmanner. CIs were less than 0.8 in all three cell lines and \nthree KRAS G12C inhibitors (Fig. 2). Synergism or dose-\ndependent suppression by monotherapy has not yet been \nconfirmed in KRAS wild type squamous cell carcinoma \ncell lines (H520). The MTS assay also showed synergism \nbetween KRAS G12C and mTOR inhibition in adenocar­\ncinoma (H23) and squamous cell carcinoma (Calu-1) cell \nlines (Fig. 3).\nImpact of mTOR on tumor growth in lung adenocarcinoma \nand squamous cell carcinoma harboring KRAS G12C\nNext, we evaluated the effect of mTOR suppression on \ntumor growth. Expression of mTOR was suppressed by \nsiRNA and cell growth was compared with that of intact \nH23 and Calu-1 cell lines. The MTS assay showed sup­\npressed cell growth following mTOR inhibition in both \ncell lines (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the activa­\ntion of mTOR is involved in the tumor growth of KRAS \nG12C-driving lung cancer.\nAlternative pathway activation by mono- or combination \ntreatment targeting KRAS G12C and/or mTOR\nWestern blotting revealed that KRAS G12C inhibition \nsuppressed ERK and PI3K- protein kinase B (AKT)-\nmTOR pathways. Expression of activated GTP-bound \nRAS was induced by a single mTOR inhibitor. The expres­\nsion of phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) and AKT \n(Ser473) was also elevated, suggesting the activation of \nthe RAS-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. The \nFig. 1  Expression of mRNA after KRAS G12C inhibition in three cell lines. (A) Comprehensive RNA-Seq results are shown as volcanic plots.

Real-time PCR analysis confirmed a significantly greater increase in mTOR mRNA levels \nin the H23 cell line compared to the intact cell lines\n \nPage 6 of 11\nIto et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2025) 23:220 \nFig. 2 (See legend on next page.)\n \nPage 7 of 11\nIto et al. Cell Communication and Signaling          (2025) 23:220 \ncombination treatment inhibited these alterations and \nsignificantly suppressed the expression of GTP-bound \nRAS and phosphorylated mTOR (Ser2448) (Fig. 4B).\nThe elevation of phosphorylated ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), \nAKT (Ser473), and GTP-bound RAS induced by mTOR \nsingle inhibition suggested that mTOR activation is cru­\ncial for maintaining tumor growth in KRAS G12C-driven \nlung cancer, and suppression of mTOR was restored by \nthe alternative activation of GTP-bound KRAS, resulting \nin ERK elevation as a downstream change of the RAS-\nMEK-ERK pathway. Targeting KRAS G12C and mTOR \nin combination abrogates GTP-RAS, pmTOR, and pERK \nexpression Although pAKT was elevated even with com­\nbined inhibition, this may be due to the steady suppres­\nsion of mTOR in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (see Fig. \n5).\nDiscussion\nKRAS is one of the most frequently identified onco-\ndriving genes in lung cancer, particularly in Western \ncountries [30]. In oncogenic KRAS-mutant cases, RAS \nproteins are binary molecular switches that convert \nactive GTP-bound to inactive guanosine diphosphate \n(GDP)-bound forms. KRAS mutations maintain their \nactive form by compromising GTPase and GTPase-acti­\nvating protein (GAPs) activity, which hydrolyzes GTP to \nGDP [16, 31, 32].\nSeveral treatment approaches have been suggested \nfor RAS-mutant tumors: inhibition of RAS processing, \ninhibition in the upstream or downstream of the RAS \npathway, or synthetic lethality strategies [3, 33, 34]. As \ncombination therapy, preclinical studies and clinical tri­\nals have been conducted [35].\nWe used three KRAS G12C inhibitors, including two \nclinically approved agents with RAD001 (everolimus), \nwhich is clinically available for treating breast cancer, \nkidney cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors.\nSotorasib (AMG 510) and adagrasib (MRTX849) \nmonotherapies have shown therapeutic efficacy in \nNSCLC in clinical phase I-II trials [36–38]. ARS-1620 \ninhibited RAS-GDP and atropisomerically inhibited \nKRAS G12C activity [39].\nCombination therapy suppressing GTP-bound KRAS \nand mTOR is classified as “co-targeting a critical down­\nstream node” [35]. A previous study suggested mTOR, \nIGF1R, and KRAS G12 inhibition by ARS-1620 mark­\nedly increased tumor regression in three different \nKRAS-driven lung cancer mouse models compared to \nmTOR, IGF1R, and MEK inhibition [40]. The combina­\ntion of the PI3K inhibitor and ARS-1620 showed effi­\ncacy in the KRAS G12C NSCLC model [28]. Phase I-II \ntrials combining sotorasib and several inhibitors, includ­\ning mTOR inhibitors, are ongoing (NCT05840510 and \nNCT04185883) [27].\nHere, we showed that the activation of mTOR was \ninduced by KRAS G12C inhibition in three different types \nof cell lines, and a single inhibition of mTOR induced a \nfeedback enhancement in GTP-bound RAS, leading to \nRAS-MEK-ERK pathway activation. Dual inhibition of \nKRAS G12C and mTOR abrogated the RAS-MEK-ERK \nand phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR \ncascades and suppressed tumor growth more effectively. \nThe PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is activated by RAS in \nKRAS-mutant lung cancers [41, 42] and has been sug­\ngested as a promising candidate target for combination \ntherapy.\nGenetically targeted therapies have been developed \nalmost exclusively for adenocarcinomas. We confirmed \nsimilar alternate changes by KRAS G12C or mTOR inhi­\nbition in different phenotypes of lung cancer cell lines. \nKRAS G12C can also occur in non-adenocarcinoma lung \ncancers. The incidence of KRAS mutations in lung squa­\nmous cell carcinoma ranged 0–14% (median: 4.5% from \n13 studies) [2]. Targeted therapy has been suggested to be \neffective in non-adenocarcinoma cases harboring targe­\ntable genetic variants [43, 44]. We have previously shown \nthat targeting specific gene expression could be effective \nin both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, \neven if the target signal does not stem from oncogenic \nmutations [45]. Skoulidis et al. divided KRAS-mutant \nlung adenocarcinoma by co-occurring genomic altera­\ntions into three subtypes and found that mTORC1 sig­\nnaling was inactivated in a subtype characterized by the \nabsence of TP53 or STK11/LKB1 mutations [46]. H23 \nincluded cancer gene mutations in STK11 and TP53, and \nHOP-62 harbored mutations in TP53 (Additional file 1: \nSupplementary Table 1). De novo mTORC1 suppres­\nsion might not occur in H23 and HOP-62, but no data \nregarding Calu-1 cell lines exist. We tried to reveal the \ngenetic features, including TP53/STK11/LKB1 mutations \n(See figure on previous page.)\nFig. 2  Clonogenic assay in three cell lines treated using three KRAS G12C inhibitors and mTOR inhibitor.

Although the inci­\ndence of KRAS G12C in squamous cell carcinoma was \nnot significantly different compared with adenocarci­\nnoma (1.8% (2/113) vs. 2.9% (25/877), p-value = 0.721), \nthe number of squamous cell carcinoma cases was too \nsmall. Further exploration of a combination strategy tar­\ngeting mTOR is warranted in the mTORC1-suppressed \nsubtype and more non-adenocarcinoma cases with KRAS \nG12C mutation. We evaluated the pathway change as a \npotential mechanism in drug resistance. However, we \ndid not directly confirm cell lines with mTOR activation \nFig. 4  Impact of mTOR expression on cell growth and western blotting results in H23 and Calu-1 cell lines.

Further research which vali­\ndates mTOR activation induced by KRAS G12C inhibi­\ntion can be a resistant mechanism in several lung cancer \nphenotypes is warranted.\nConclusions\nActivation of mTOR has been suggested as an alternative \nchange induced by KRAS G12C inhibition, and mTOR \nsolo-inhibition induces GTP-bound KRAS activation. \nA combination strategy inhibiting GTP-bound KRAS \nG12C and mTOR is promising for primary lung cancers \nharboring a KRAS G12C mutation. This combination \nstrategy might be effective for lung cancers harboring \nKRAS G12C mutation regardless of difference in histol­\nogy, treatment agent, coexisting oncological mutations, \nor EMT phenotype.\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at ​h​t​t​p​s​:​/​/​d​o​i​.​o​r​\ng​/​1​0​.​1​1​8​6​/​s​1​2​9​6​4​-​0​2​5​-​0​2​1​8​7​-​y.\nSupplementary Material 1\nSupplementary Material 2\nSupplementary Material 3\nSupplementary Material 4\nSupplementary Material 5\nSupplementary Material 6\nSupplementary Material 7\nSupplementary Material 8\nSupplementary Material 9: Supplementary Table 1.

Shokat\na,c\naDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; \nbDepartment of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; cDepartment of Chemistry, University \nof California, Berkeley, CA, USA\nABSTRACT\nKRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer. In multiple types of cancer, \na missense mutation at codon 12 substitutes a glycine for a cysteine, causing hyperactivation of \nthe GTPase and enhanced MAPK signalling. Recent drug discovery efforts culminating from work \nduring the past decade have resulted in two FDA-approved inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib, \nwhich target the KRASG12C mutant allele. Ongoing medicinal chemistry efforts across academia \nand industry have continued developing more potent and efficacious KRASG12C inhibitors. One \nagent in late-stage clinical trials, divarasib, has demonstrated robust overall response rates, in \nsome cases greater than currently approved agents. Divarasib also exhibits enhanced covalent \ntarget engagement in vitro and significant specificity for KRASG12C, yet the structural details of its \nbinding have not been published. Here we report a high-resolution crystal structure of cysteine- \nlight KRAS-4BG12C in complex with divarasib. Though it binds in the same allosteric pocket as \nsotorasib and adagrasib, the switch-II loop in each crystal structure takes on a distinct conforma­\ntion differing as much as 5.6 Å between the Cα atom of residue 65 with sotorasib. Additionally, we \nhighlight structural features of the drug complex that may guide future medicinal chemistry \nefforts targeting various KRAS alleles.\nARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 22 November 2024  \nRevised 3 May 2025  \nAccepted 6 May 2025  \nKEYWORDS\nKRAS; oncogene; divarasib; \nstructure; inhibitor\nIntroduction\nSmall GTPases such as KRAS are composed of \na G-domain and a hypervariable region that cycle \nbetween an inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP- \nbound) conformation [1]. The G-domain is responsible \nfor binding nucleotide and coordinating effector bind­\ning. Hotspot mutations in the P-loop of the G-domain \nsuch as KRASG12V, KRASG12D, and KRASG12C perturb \nthe normal equilibrium by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis \nand locking KRAS in its active conformation [1,2]. \nThough KRASG12C is the third most common allele, \ninitial studies focused on taking advantage of the \nnucleophilic cysteine handle to trap KRASG12C in its \ninactive state [3].\nTwo FDA-approved therapies, sotorasib and adagra­\nsib, which covalently modify the GDP-bound state of \nKRASG12C were approved in 2021 and 2022, respec­\ntively [4,5]. These two first-in-class agents demon­\nstrated the druggability of KRAS almost four decades \nafter it was first identified as a human oncogene [6]. \nThree \nadditional \ncovalent \nKRASG12C \ninhibitors \ncurrently undergoing clinical trials (olomorasib- \nLY3537982, opnurasib-JDQ443, and divarasib-GDC \n-6036) have also reported encouraging clinical out­\ncomes [7,8]. More recently, the development of BI- \n0474 also targeting the inactive KRASG12C state was \ndisclosed, demonstrating potent in vitro engagement \nand good pharmacodynamics [9]. Co-crystal structures \nof advanced KRASG12C drugs have facilitated the devel­\nopment of next-generation inhibitors as well as mole­\ncules targeting other alleles, yet not all the structures \nare available in the public domain. Specifically, divar­\nasib is currently in clinical trials for NSCLC and has \nresulted in the highest overall response rate of up to \n56.4%, yet its co-crystal structure coordinates have not \nbeen published or deposited in the PDB [10,11].\nImproved understanding of KRASG12C engagement \nvia this cryptic pocket has accelerated medicinal chem­\nistry efforts and resulted in numerous lead compounds. \nWe became particularly interested in the bound struc­\nture of divarasib because of its emergence in a chemical \ngenetic screen in our laboratory demonstrating the \nCONTACT Kevan M.

Here we present a 1.90 Å resolution crystal \nstructure of KRASG12C, C51S, C80S, C118S bound to divar­\nasib. Examination of the structure revealed key residues \nimportant for binding and activation of the covalent \ninhibitor in the pocket. Notably, we observed some key \ndifferences between this structure and other published \nstructures of GDP-bound KRASG12C complexed to ada­\ngrasib, sotorasib, opnurasib, or BI-0474. These compar­\nisons highlight the diversity in covalent switch-II pocket \nengagement and could advance our understanding of \ndistinct drug binding modes.\nResults\nThe KRASG12C drug candidate, ARS-1620, demon­\nstrated in vivo tumour growth inhibition for the first \ntime, verifying the potential of KRAS-targeted therapy \n[13]. It established the effectiveness of a quinazoline \ncore while maintaining the acrylamide warhead from \ncompound 12 [14]. Extensive medicinal chemistry \nefforts from Amgen, Mirati Therapeutics (BMS), and \nGenentech (Roche) derivatized the core to optimize \nin vitro potency and overall bioavailability. Each of \nthese \nmolecules \nengages \nthe \ninactive \nstate \nof \nKRASG12C via the allosteric switch-II pocket in \na slightly different orientation, taking advantage of the \ndynamic environment. Novartis relied on in silico opti­\nmization and structure-based design to develop opnur­\nasib, employing a distinct mono-cyclic scaffold and \namide linker while still utilizing the acrylamide war­\nhead (Figure 1a) [15]. Boehringer Ingelheim in colla­\nboration with the Fesik group took advantage of an \ninitial reversible fragment screen and structure-based \ndesign to ultimately design BI-0474 (Figure 1a) [9]. \nThe structure of the GDP-bound KRASG12C ● divar­\nasib complex was determined at 1.90 Å by replicating \nthe crystallization conditions for sotorasib (Figure 1b). \nFollowing molecular replacement with the apoprotein, \nelectron density in the switch-II pocket indicated an \nadduct with cysteine 12 with an interatomic distance of \n1.83 Å being consistent with a carbon-cysteine bond. \nApart from partial density for the Gln 61 sidechain, the \nswitch-II loop is well defined (Figure S2). Though Glu \n63’s carboxyl group has elevated B-factors near 50 Å2, \nresidues of the switch-II loop have only moderate \nB-factors with the average between residues 58 and 76 \nbeing 33.5 Å2.\nDivarasib forms several key interactions in the \nswitch-II pocket of KRASG12C. In the back of the \npocket, Lys 16 is positioned 1.9 Å from the carbonyl \nof the acrylamide to form a hydrogen bond (Figure 1c). \nTyr 96 sits behind the core to form the hydrophobic \nbase of the pocket (Figure 1c). Interestingly, a water \nmolecule is present in a network with Thr 58 and Gly \n10 and not displaced by the methylpiperazine \n(Figure 1c). This water is also conserved in a structure \nof an adagrasib precursor, prompting the addition of \na cyanomethyl group to the final compound 3.3 Å from \nthe Gly 10 backbone (Figure S1B) [4].\nDivarasib extends into the pocket forming interac­\ntions with the switch-II loop and α2 helix. The quinazo­\nline core of divarasib is positioned to form a hydrogen \nbond with His 95 while Tyr 64 and Glu 62 extend from \nthe switch-II loop to form a lid (Figure 1d). In the back \nof the pocket, a second water molecule forms a network \nwith Glu 63, Arg 68 and the pyridine’s tertiary amine \n(Figure 1d). The pyridine also coordinates with Asp 69 \nand Glu 63 via its primary amine at distances of 2.1 Å \n(Figure 1d).\nThe mono- or bi- cyclic cores of each inhibitor \nalign well in the crystal structures though differences \nexist between how the R groups engage with the \npocket (Figures 2a and S1). In the solvent-exposed \nregion, divarasib and adagrasib take advantage of the \nsame methylpyrrolidine substituent, however, sotor­\nasib differs with only a carbonyl at this position \n(Figure 1d). The isopropyl-methylpyridine off the \nN1 position of sotorasib is reported to bind in \na novel His 95-groove defined by its flipped-out \nconformation (Figure S1A) [5]. Compared to ARS- \n1620, this allows more depth to the pocket and \nincreases van der Waals interactions. Opnurasib’s \nindazole binds in a similar region with His 95 \noriented away from the drug towards the solvent \n(Figure S1C). In contrast, divarasib and adagrasib \nboth take advantage of the protonated N3 of His 95 \nfor hydrogen bonding to the core (Figures 2c and \nS1B). Accordingly, acquired resistance mechanisms \nagainst treatment with adagrasib include missense \nmutations such as H95D/Q/R7. In the crystal struc­\nture of BI-0474, His 95 also points inward, though it \nis further from the pyridine core and instead inter­\nacts with Tyr 64 (Figure S1D) [9].\nThe switch-II loop itself varies between the struc­\ntures as well. The loops are well defined in each of the \ncrystal structures except for partial density often seen \nfor the Glu 61 sidechain. The most striking observation \nis the distance between the Cαs at Ser 65 which is 5.6 Å \nin the sotorasib and divarasib structures (Figure 2b). \nSimilar to His 95, Glu 62 is flipped out and away from \nsotorasib, whereas it makes an interaction with the \nmethylpyrrolidine \nof \ndivarasib \nand \nadagrasib \n(Figures 2c and S1B). Additionally, Tyr 64 is flipped \nout in the sotorasib and opnurasib structures but \nencloses the pocket with the other drugs.\n2\nM. C.

This residue has been proposed to activate \nthe ligand for 1,4 addition by the thiolate [16]. The \nlysine is positioned in each structure to stabilize the \ntransition state oxyanion and forms a hydrogen bond \nwith the carbonyl in the crystal structures (Figures 2c \nand S1).\nThe lipophilic pocket at the back of the switch-II \npocket supports hydrophobic packing (Figure 1b,d). \nDivarasib’s pyridine substituent contains a CF3 group, \nwhile sotorasib employs a fluorine, and adagrasib utilizes \nan 8-chloronaphthyl that positions chlorine to fill this \nsub-pocket (Figure 1a). Notably, the synthesis of divar­\nasib isolated the active atropisomer to position the pyr­\nidine perpendicular to the core for the CF3 group to fill \nFigure 1.

On the other hand, BI-0474’s \nunique benzothiophene substituent is linked to the core \nvia an oxadiazole to reach into this sub-pocket \n(Figure S1D).\nOpnurasib was optimized from structure-based de \nnovo screen and exhibits a slightly different binding \nmode [15]. It is pushed up against the wall of the \nswitch-II loop to contact residues along the loop and \nα2 helix such as Ser 65 and Asp 69 while avoiding \ninteraction with Tyr 96 and His 95 (Figure S1). In \ncontrast, divarasib reaches to make an interaction \nwith Asp 69 while maintaining a hydrogen bond to \nHis 95; a unique combination not seen in the other \ndrug complexes (Figures 1d and S1).\nDiscussion\nPotent state-selective switch-II pocket inhibitors have \nrevolutionized the treatment of KRASG12C-driven \ntumours [3].

In 2022, the \ndevelopment \nof \ndivarasib \nwas \nannounced \nby \nGenentech (Roche) at the AACR meeting with signifi­\ncantly improved in vitro and in vivo potency compared \nto ARS-1620 [11]. In this work, we report a crystal \nstructure of GDP-bound KRASG12C in complex with \ndivarasib and highlight elements of switch-II pocket \nengagement. The drug makes interactions throughout \nthe switch-II pocket, taking advantage of both polar \nand hydrophobic contacts such as His 95 and Asp 69.\nFurthermore, the switch-II pocket varies among each \ncomplex and suggests varied engagement of the region \n(Movie S1). However, inferences from crystal structures \nare limited to comparisons between static structures \ncaptured in a lattice and do not fully represent the \nphysiological state of the protein. Crystal contacts \nbetween monomers can also affect the protein’s con­\nformation, though divarasib’s switch-II, α2, and \nα3 helix region do not directly participate in these \ncontacts. Additionally, different buffer conditions were \nused to obtain opnurasib, adagrasib, and BI-0474 co- \ncrystal structures which may affect the final conforma­\ntion of the protein complex.\nMaterials and methods\nProtein expression and purification\nThe KRASG12C DNA sequence encoding the human \nCys-light allele (residues 1–169) was codon opti­\nmized, synthesized, and cloned into the pProEx \nvector by GenScript. KRASG12C protein was purified \nusing previously published methods [12]. Briefly, \na colony from transformed BL21(DE3) cells grown \non LB agar plates was used to inoculate terrific \nbroth containing 50 µg/mL carbenicillin. When the \noptical density reached 0.6 at 37ºC, the culture tem­\nperature was reduced to 18ºC, and protein expres­\nsion was induced by the addition of IPTG to 1 mm. \nAfter 16 h at 18ºC, the cells were pelleted by cen­\ntrifugation (19,000 × g, 25 min) and lysed in lysis \nbuffer [20 mm Tris 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imida­\nzole] with EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Sigma- \nAldrich) using ultrasonication (40% duty cycle for \n3 × 3 min cycles). The lysate was clarified by high- \nspeed centrifugation (19,000 × g, 15 min). The \nsupernatant was incubated with Co-TALON resin \n(Clonetech, Takara Bio USA, 2 mL slurry/litre cul­\nture) at 4ºC for 1 h with constant end-to-end mix­\ning. After washing with lysis buffer (30 mL/litre \nculture), the protein was eluted with elution buffer \n[20 mm Tris 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole]. \nTo this protein solution was added 0.05 mg of His- \ntagged TEV protease (Berkeley QB3 MacroLab) and \n1 mg of GDP per mg of protein. The mixture was \ndialysed against TEV Cleavage Buffer [20 mm Tris \n8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, \n1 mm DTT] at 4 ºC using a 10K MWCO dialysis \ncassette (Fisher Scientific) until LC-MS analysis \nshowed full cleavage (typically 16–24 hr.). MgCl2 \nwas added to a final concentration of 5 mm and \nthe mixture was incubated with 2 mL Ni-NTA \n(Qiagen) beads at 4 ºC for 1 h to remove residual \nHis-tagged proteins and peptides. The protein was \nconcentrated using a 10K MWCO centrifugal con­\ncentrator (Amicon-15, Millipore) to a volume of 1  \nmL and purified by size exclusion chromatography \non a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column using SEC \nbuffer [20 mm HEPES 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm \nMgCl2] (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Fractions \nwere pooled for crystallography and stored at  \n− 78ºC.\nCrystallography\nDivarasib (MedChemExpress) was added to 6 mg of \npure protein as a 50 mm solution in DMSO. The \nmixture was allowed to stand at 23ºC until LC-MS \nanalysis of the reaction mixture showed full conver­\nsion to a single covalent adduct (19951 Da). The reac­\ntion \nmixture \nwas \npurified \nby \nsize \nexclusion \nchromatography (Superdex75, 20 mm HEPES 7.5, \n150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) and concentrated to 60  \nmg/mL using a 10K MWCO centrifugal concentrator \n(Amicon-15, Millipore). Crystals were grown at 20ºC \nin a 96-well plate utilizing hanging-drop vapour diffu­\nsion. Crystals grew in the previously established con­\ndition for the KRASG12C ∙ sotorasib complex (1 mm \nMgCl2, 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 30% PEG4000) and then \nwere transferred to a cryoprotectant solution com­\nposed of the well solution supplemented with 20% \nethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. \nThe dataset was collected with a Pilatus3 6 M 100 hz \ndetector and a wavelength of 1.02978 Å at 100 K at the \nAdvanced Light Source beamline 2.0.1. The dataset \nwas indexed and integrated using iMosflm and deter­\nmined by molecular replacement using Phaser in the \nPHENIX software suite [18–20]. The crystal structure \nof GDP-bound K-Ras(G12C)-sotorasib adduct (PDB \n6OIM) was used as the initial model. The structure \nwas manually refined with Coot and PHENIX [21]. \nData collection and refinement statistics are listed in \nTable S1. Structural visualization was carried out in \nPyMOL and ChimeraX [22,23].\nSMALL GTPASES\n5\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Julius Pampel and Johannes Morstein for their \nhelpful discussions.

The development of selective, cova-\nlent KRAS G12C (KRASG12C) inhibitors represents a breakthrough in the treatment\nfor KRASG12C mutant NSCLC, but the durability of response and efficacy of these in-\nhibitors are limited by the rapid emergence of drug resistance and their ability to only\nbind KRASG12C in the guanosine diphosphate‐bound form. Importantly, co‐occurring\ngene alterations, including KEAP1, STK11, and CDKN2A, may affect prognosis and\nresponse to therapies, including immunotherapy and KRASG12C inhibitors. New\ntherapeutic approaches are needed to both delay and overcome treatment resistance.\nMoreover, developing KRAS inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action and alter-\nnative allele specificities is necessary to overcome emerging on‐target resistance\nmechanisms to KRASG12C inhibitors. A literature search was performed using\nPubMed, the Food and Drug Administration website, and Google search. The inclusive\ndates in the literature search were between 1982 and July 2024. In this article, the\nauthors reviewed the disease prevalence, biology and therapeutic options, including\nspecific KRASG12C inhibitors and new pan‐KRAS therapeutic agents for KRASG12C\nmutant NSCLC. KRAS inhibitor resistance mechanisms, treatment strategies, and\nmulti‐targeted treatment approaches are also discussed.\nK E Y W O R D S\nadaptive resistance, KRASG12C mutation, RAS OFF, RAS ON\nINTRODUCTION\nKirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) has long been recognized as one of the\nmost frequently mutated oncogenic drivers in human cancers. The\nKRAS activating mutation is one of the most common molecular non–\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtypes comprising 25%–32% of lung\nadenocarcinoma and is mutually exclusive with other targetable al-\nterations, including EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK1‐3, and\nHER2.1,2 Despite its prevalence and essential role in tumor cell\ngrowth and survival, KRAS was considered “undruggable” due to its\nhigh affinity for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Significant efforts\nhave been dedicated to targeting RAS proteins over the last several\ndecades.3 These efforts culminated in clinical success with the\napproval of the two KRASG12C inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib, in\npatients with NSCLC, both under the accelerated approval pathway\nbased on phase 2 clinical trial results (Table 1).\nThe findings and conclusions in this supplement are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the American Cancer Society, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., or the\nopinions of the journal editors.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution‐NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any\nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Tumor\ncells with on‐target resistance or adaptive resistance remain depen-\ndent on KRAS signaling, whereas those with off‐target mechanisms\nactivate bypass pathways to support proliferation and cell survival.\nTissue and liquid biopsies and genotyping of resistant clinical samples\ncan elucidate resistance mechanisms and guide therapeutic decisions.\nHowever, challenges remain in addressing the diverse and polyclonal\nresistance mechanisms and preventing the emergence of resistance in\nthe treatment‐naive setting.\nIn this review, we provide an overview of the RAS pathway in\nNSCLC with an emphasis on KRASG12C mutation and currently\napproved inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib. We explore potential\nstrategies for additional therapeutic targeting for KRASG12C and\nother KRAS alterations. Additionally, we examine several resistance\nmechanisms to KRASG12C inhibition and possible therapeutic ap-\nproaches to overcome them. Finally, we discuss the novel KRASG12C\ninhibitors currently being evaluated in clinical studies.\nKRAS MUTATIONS IN NSCLC\nThe RAS superfamily proteins (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) are G‐\nproteins with intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity\nthat act downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and, on\nactivation, induces the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK/\nERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K) pathways as well as\nmany others key signaling pathways (Figure 1). KRAS is an enzyme\nthat cycles between the GTP wild type (WT) (ON) and guanosine\ndiphosphate (GDP) (OFF) states and regulates normal cell prolifer-\nation, growth, and survival.16,17 Mutant KRAS has reduced intrinsic\nGTPase activity and decreased ability to efficiently interact with\nGTPase activating proteins (GAPS), resulting in abnormally high\nconcentrations of GTP‐bound KRAS, driving downstream activation\nof MAPK and PI3K pathway. KRAS mutations were first discovered in\n1982 in NSCLC and are found in 5% of small cell lung cancer and\n~25% of lung adenocarcinomas.18,19,20,21 Oncogenic mutations most\nfrequently affect codons G12, G13, and Q61. The KRASG12C mutation\nis the most prevalent (41%), followed by G12V (21%) and G12F/D\n(17%) (Figure 1).22 Mutations in KRASG12C represent approximately\n14% of adenocarcinomas, and 1%–4% of squamous NSCLCs are\nlinked to a more aggressive clinical phenotype and are a prognostic\nfactor for survival in NSCLC.11,12\nKRAS OFF INHIBITORS\nTargeting KRAS directly has been challenging due to its essential role\nin normal tissue development and the toxicities associated with\nblanket inhibition of WT RAS protein.

After a phase 1 study\ndemonstrated activity in KRASG12C mutant solid tumors, including\nNSCLC in a single arm, the phase 2 CodeBreak100 study evaluated\nF I G U R E 1\nTargeting RAS with RAS‐OFF and RAS‐ON inhibitors in NSCLC. RAS is a G‐protein that acts downstream of receptor tyrosine\nkinases (RTKs) and, on activation, induces the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways as well as many other key signaling pathways. Ras activation\ninduces tumor cell proliferation, growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. RAS activity is regulated through its intrinsic GTPase activity\nand thus cycles between the GTP (ON) state and GDP (OFF) state. KRAS alterations found in NSCLC affect codons G12, G13, and Q61. The\nKRASG12C mutation is found in NSCLC, the most prevalent (41%), followed by G12V (21%), G12D (17%), G12A (7%), G12S (5%), G13* (5%),\nQ61* (2%), and G12F/R (1%–2%). Multiple RAS‐OFF (GDP‐bound RAS) and RAS‐ON (GTP‐bound RAS) inhibitors have recently been\ndeveloped to target KRAS G12C, KRAS G12D, or multiple KRAS mutant alleles. Many of these are currently being tested in the clinic. GDP\nindicates guanosine diphosphate; GTPase, guanosine triphosphatase; KRAS, Kirsten rat sarcoma; MAPK/ERK, mitogen‐activated protein\nkinase; NSCLC, non–small cell lung cancer; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases. *Food and Drug\nAdministration approved.\n4 of 11\n-\nADVANCES IN KRASG12C NSCLC TREATMENT\nsotorasib in patients with mNSCLC previously treated with anti‐\nprogrammed death 1 (PD‐1) or anti‐programmed death ligand 1\n(PD‐L1) immunotherapy or platinum‐based chemotherapy or after\nchemoimmunotherapy.14,16 The majority of patients received both\nchemotherapy and immunotherapy (81%) and had two or more lines\nof treatment (57%). Patients with active or untreated brain metas-\ntasis (BM) were excluded. The study’s primary end point was objec-\ntive response (OR) by blinded, independent central review (BICR).\nKey secondary end points were duration of response (DOR), disease\ncontrol, defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or\nstable disease (SD) according to RECIST, version 1.1, time to\nresponse, progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and\nsafety.4,5 The median follow‐up was 15.3 months, with a median DOR\nof 5.5 months. In 124 evaluable patients, the objective response rate\n(ORR) was 37.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.6–46.2) with a\ndisease control rate of 80.6% (95% CI, 72.6–87.2). Sotorasib\ndemonstrated a modified PFS (mPFS) of 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.1–8.2)\nwith modified OS (mOS) of 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.0–not evaluable\n[NE]). Sotorasib was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to receive acceler-\nated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for patients with\nKRASG12C‐driven advanced NSCLC in the second‐line settings (May\n28, 2021).5,25 The 2‐year pooled analysis of CodeBreak100 was\nconsistent with initially reported data; median DOR was 5.6 months\nwith mPFS of 6.3 months (95% CI, 5.3–8.2) and mOS of 12.5 months\n(95% CI, 10.0–17.8).26 Sotorasib was generally well tolerated, with\nthe most commonly reported treatment‐related adverse effects\n(TRAEs) being gastrointestinal toxicities, including diarrhea (31.7%),\nnausea (19.0%), increase in ALT/AST (15.1%), and fatigue (11.1%).\nThe grade 3–4 TRAEs occurred in 20.6% of patients. Additionally,\npermanent drug discontinuation due to TRAEs occurred in 7.1% of\npatients, with diarrhea (7.9%) and AST/ALT elevation (7.9%) being\nthe most frequent reason.5\nAs part of the post‐marketing requirement to confirm the clinical\nbenefit of sotorasib, the CodeBreak200, a randomized, phase 3 trial,\nevaluated the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxel,\nin KRASG12C mutant NSCLC after progression on standard of care\n(SOC) platinum‐based chemotherapy and/or PD‐1/PD‐L1 inhibitors.6\nThe primary end point was PFS by BICR, and secondary end points\nincluded OS, ORR, DOR, DCR, time to response, safety, sotorasib\npharmacokinetics,\nand\npatient‐reported\noutcomes.\nThe\nstudy\ndemonstrated significant improvement in PFS in the Sotorasib arm at\n5.6 months (95% CI, 4.3–7.8) compared to docetaxel at 4.5 months\n(95% CI, 3.0–5.7) with hazard ratio (HR), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51–0.86);\np = .0017.6 However, OS did not differ between treatment arms, HR.\n1.01 (95% CI, 0.77–1.33), 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.9–14.0) in the\nsotorasib group versus 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.0–14.9) in the doce-\ntaxel group (Table 1). Substantial dropout rate was observed in\ndocetaxel arm, which potentially undermined the randomization and\naffected study results. Additionally, crossover from docetaxel to\nsotorasib occurred in 26% of patients, and an additional 7% of pa-\ntients received KRASG12C inhibitor after discontinuation from the\nstudy. Furthermore, patients treated with sotorasib were less\naffected by TRAEs and their quality‐of‐life remained stable compared\nto patients receiving docetaxel.27 Grade ≥3 TRAEs were reported in\n33% and 40% in sotorasib and docetaxel groups, respectively.\nDiscontinuation due to TRAEs was seen in 10% and 11% of patients,\nwith hepatotoxicity being the most common reason (2.4%) for\nsotorasib discontinuation due to TRAEs, particularly in those who\nhad received prior immunotherapy within 2.6 months.6\nDespite sotorasib showing better PFS, a more favorable toxicity\nprofile than docetaxel several study design limitations raise concerns\nabout the reliability of PFS and OS estimates. These limitations\ninclude the use of suboptimal control arm with docetaxel alone\nrather than combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab, sample size\nreduction, allowance of crossover without BICR, and imbalanced\ncensoring rates. Furthermore, on October 5, 2023, the FDA’s\nOncologic Drug Advisory Committee determined that the PFS of\nsotorasib cannot be reliably interpreted in comparison to docetaxel\ndue to these factors.28 Last, several articles reported real‐world data\nregarding tolerability and efficacy of sotorasib in patients with\nadvanced NSCLC harboring KRASG12C were similar to reported in the\nCodeBreak trials.29,30\nAdagrasib, another covalent inhibitor of KRASG12C mutant pro-\ntein, was evaluated in KRYSTAL‐1, a multicenter, phase 2 single‐arm\nexpansion cohort trial after demonstrating clinical activity in phase 1/\n1b study with 53.3% (95% CI, 26.6–78.7) in previously treated pa-\ntients with NSCLC.7,31 After the median follow‐up of 15.6 months,\nadagrasib demonstrated an ORR of 42.9 (95% CI, 33.5–52.6) with a\nmedian DOR of 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.2–13.8), PFS was 6.5 months\n(95% CI, 4.7–8.4) and mOS was 12.6 (95% CI, 9.2–19.2).31 Adagrasib\nreceived accelerated approval from the FDA for the treatment of\nadvanced NSCLC harboring KRASG12C in the second line setting\n(December 12, 2022). Although relatively well tolerated, the most\ncommonly reported TRAEs were gastrointestinal toxicities, including\ndiarrhea (62.9%), nausea (62.1%), vomiting (47.4%), fatigue (40.5%),\nand elevated liver enzymes (27.6%). The ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 44.8%\nof patients with the most noted fatigue (4.3%), nausea (4.3%),\nincreased ALT (4.3%), and 1.7% grade 5 fatal cardiac events. Addi-\ntionally, permanent discontinuation of adagrasib due to TRAEs\noccurred in 6.9% of patients. Interestingly, plasma circulating tumor\nDNA (ctDNA) analysis in 60 patients with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC\ndemonstrated that ctDNA clearance at cycle 2 was associated with\nORR of 60.6% compared to patients with incomplete ctDNA clear-\nance at 33.3%.32 Furthermore, ctDNA clearance at cycle 4 was\nassociated with improved OS 14.7 months versus 5.4 months,\nrespectively, suggesting that ctDNA response has the potential to be\na biomarker of treatment outcomes in patients with KRASG12C\nmutant NSCLC.32\nMore recently, KRYSTAL‐12, a randomized, phase 3 trial,\ncompared adagrasib with docetaxel in patients with KRASG12C mutant\nNSCLC after progression on chemoimmunotherapy.9 The primary\nend point was PFS, assessed by BICR, and secondary end points were\nORR, DOR, OS, 1‐year OS, and safety. The study allowed crossover\nto adagrasib on progression on docetaxel. Adagrasib demonstrated\nsignificant improvement in PFS 5.49 versus 3.84 months compared to\ndocetaxel (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45–0.76; p < .0001). Additionally, ORR\nSHAVERDASHVILI and BURNS\n-\n5 of 11\nwas 31.9% (95% CI, 26.7–37.5) versus 9.2% (95% CI, 5.1–15.0) and\nmedian DOR was 8.31 (95% CI, 6.05–10.35) versus 5.36 (95% CI,\n2.86–8.54) months, respectively. In summary, adagrasib demon-\nstrated improvement in both PFS and ORR compared to docetaxel in\npatients with previously treated KRASG12C NSCLC. Similar to the\nCodeBreak200, a lower ORR and PFS benefit was observed\ncompared to KRYSTAL‐1, and the PFS benefit compared to docetaxel\nwas only marginally improved (Table 1). The most commonly\nobserved TRAEs were more frequent with adagrasib versus doce-\ntaxel, including diarrhea (53% vs. 30%), vomiting (35% vs. 6%), and\nnausea (34% vs. 19%). Last, grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 47% of the\nadagrasib arm versus 45.7% in the docetaxel arm, with discontinua-\ntion of therapy in 7.7% and 14.3% of patients, respectively.\nGiven the relatively low activity of these agents, several studies\nhave examined whether certain subsets of patients experienced\ngreateror lesserbenefit from thefirst‐generation KRASG12C inhibitors.\nThe CodeBreak100 study evaluated sotorasib response based on PD‐\nL1 expression and common KRASG12C co‐occurring mutations such as\nTP53, STK11, and KEAP1. The results demonstrated that patients with\nnegative PD‐L1 had ORR of 48% compared to 42% in the general\npopulation. Patients with WT KEAP1 but STK11 mutations had an ORR\nof 39%, compared to 50% in overall patient population. Additionally,\nfor those with both KEAP1 and STK11 mutations, the treatment\nresponse was 23% compared to 14% for patients with KEAP1 muta-\ntions but WT STK11. In the exploratory biomarker analysis of Code-\nBreak200, sotorasib showed consistent clinical benefit over docetaxel\nacross several molecular subgroups including STK11, KEAP1, and\nTP53.33 Although no definitive predictive biomarker was identified,\nhigh baseline plasma tumor burden correlated with early disease\nprogression and KRAS G12C and NOTCH1 co‐mutations may be\nassociated with shorter PFS with sotorasib compared to docetaxel.33\nMulti‐institutional real‐world data of biomarker analysis in patients\nwith KRASG12C mutant advanced NSCLC demonstrated that co‐\nalterations in KEAP1, CDKN2A, and SMARCA4 are independent fac-\ntors for shorter PFS and OS, whereas mutations in DNA damage\nresponse genes were associated with improved efficacy of KRASG12C\ninhibitors treatment.34 Furthermore, in KRYSTAL‐1 study, exploratory\nbiomarker analysis revealed that co‐mutations in STK11, KEAP1, TP53,\nand CDKN2A, were associated with ORRs of 40.5%, 28.6%, 51.4%, and\n58.3%, respectively. Additionally, adagrasib response rates ranged\nfrom 35.7% to 55.9% for patients with both KEAP1 and STK11 muta-\ntions compared to 14.3% for those with KEAP1 mutations alone. Unlike\nsotorasib, adagrasib treatment response was not significantly associ-\nated with PD‐L1 expression.\nSeveral next‐generation KRASG12C selective inhibitors with\nimproved potency over first‐in‐class inhibitors (sotorasib and ada-\ngrasib) are currently under investigation in clinical trials. Many of\nthese drugs have shown more favorable safety profile and superior\npharmacological characteristics. In the phase 1 study, divarasib\n(GDC‐6036), an oral KRASG12C inhibitor, demonstrated an ORR of\n53.4% (95% CI, 39.9–66.7), mPFS of 13.1 months (95% CI, 8.8–NE),\nand the median DOR was 14.0 months (95% CI, 8.3–NE) in patients\nwith previously treated mNSCLC.10 Although cross‐trial comparisons\nmust be interpreted cautiously, divarasib appears to show less grade\n≥3 TRAEs (11%) and numerically higher ORR (53.4%) and longer PFS\n(13.1 months) compared with sotorasib (ORR, 28%; mPFS, 5.6\nmonths) and adagrasib (ORR, 43%; mPFS, 6.5 months).4,5,10,35\nAnother second generation, highly selective KRASG12C inhibitor,\nolomorasib (LY3537982), was evaluated in LOXO‐RAS‐20001, a\nphase 1/2 study of KRASG12C mutant solid tumors including 83 pa-\ntients with NSCLC.11 In patients with NSCLC and prior KRASG12C\ninhibitor therapy, ORR was 41% and PFS was 8.1 months (95% CI,\n5.6–15.6), with an overall favorable safety profile, including those\npatients with a history of prior KRASG12C inhibitor intolerance.11 In\nsummary, encouraging antitumor activity and safety profile make\ndivarasib and olomorasib promising antitumor agents; however, it is\nstill unknown if this improved efficacy will be maintained in the larger\nongoing phase 3 clinical trials.

Given the high incidence of BM (~40%) in\npatients with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC, therapeutic agents with su-\nperior central nervous system (CNS) efficacy will likely have\nimproved efficacy.38 In the KRYSTAL‐1 trial, patients with untreated\nBM had a systemic ORR of 30% with a median intracranial DOR of\n12.7 months, and in KRYSTAL‐12, an intracranial ORR of 24% was\nobserved.9,39 Although CNS activity of sotorasib remains unknown,\nthe retrospective post hoc analysis of CodeBreak100 demonstrated\nthat 88% of patients with evaluable CNS disease achieved intracra-\nnial disease control.40 Additionally, the mOS was 8.3 months (95% CI,\n7.3–12.5) in patients with BM compared to 13.6 months (95% CI, 10–\nNE) in patients without BM.40 Furthermore, Codebreak200 included\npatients with stable, treated BM, 40 (23%) in the sotorasib arm and\n29 (17%) in the docetaxel arm.41 Sotorasib demonstrated reduced\nrisk of CNS PFS and delayed CNS recurrence compared to docetaxel\nwith 6.1 months versus 4.5 months (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.30–1.07;\np = .045).41 Lastly, early signs of clinical CNS efficacy were observed\nwith garsorasib (D‐1553) and olomorasib (LY3537982) monotherapy,\nwith intracranial ORR of 17% and 80%, respectively.11,14 Given the\nsmall number of patients, larger, dedicated BM trials are needed to\ndetermine the efficacy of current KRASG12C inhibitors in patients\nwith untreated BM.\nRAS ON INHIBITORS\nAlthough first‐generation KRASG12C (RAS OFF) inhibitors have been\ntransformative steps forward in the treatment of KRASG12C mutant\nNSCLC, suboptimal treatment response and resistance remain\n6 of 11\n-\nADVANCES IN KRASG12C NSCLC TREATMENT\nsignificant challenges. Substantial progress has been made in devel-\noping\nnovel\ntherapeutic\nstrategies,\nincluding\nnext‐generation\nKRASG12C inhibitors and broader‐acting RAS ON inhibitors.\nTrimeric complex (tri‐complex) RAS inhibitors are allele‐specific\nand pan‐allele targeting drugs that bind to RAS ON via a unique\nmechanism, acting as a molecular “glue” with cyclophilin A. RMC‐6291,\nan oral inhibitor, binds to KRASG12C and cyclophilin A (CypA), leading to\nrapid disruption of RAS effector binding and halting KRASG12C mutant‐\nmediated signaling (Figure 1). RMC‐6291, in contrast to adagrasib and\nsotorasib, covalently binds to the active GTP‐bound KRASG12C (ON)\nand CypA and forms an inactive tri‐complex, providing a novel thera-\npeutic approach to KRAS‐driven tumors. RMC‐6291 led to significant\nand lasting suppression of RAS signaling in KRASG12C mutated tumors\nand had greater efficacy than adagrasib in preclinical studies.42 Pre-\nliminary data shows promising antitumor activity of RMC‐6291 in\nNSCLC patients with KRASG12C and KRASG12C inhibitor exposure; thus,\nit potentially can be used to overcome the limitations of first‐\ngeneration KRASG12C inhibitors.42,43\nNovel RASMULTI (ON) inhibitors targeting all RAS isoforms have\nbeen developed and are tested in clinical trials. Similar to KRASG12C\n(ON) inhibitors, the drug forms a tri‐complex between active RAS and\nCypA protein. RMC‐6236 is a RASMULTI inhibitor that has shown ac-\ntivity against RAS WT and various other mutant proteins, including\nG12X, G13, and Q61.44,45,46 Several case reports showed objective\nresponses in patients with advanced KRAS G12X mutant NSCLC\npancreatic and ovarian cancers.44,45 Furthermore, a phase 1 clinical\ntrial evaluated RMC‐6236 safety and efficacy in patients with previ-\nously treated metastatic solid tumors harboring KRAS G12X (~50%\nKRAS G12D and excluding G12C) and showed radiographic tumor\nregression and reduction in KRAS mutant alleles in blood ctDNA across\nthe tumor types indicating antitumor activity (NCT05379985).44,45,46\nThe most common grade 3 TRAE was rash; only one patient experi-\nenced grade 4 intestinal perforation at the tumor site. Overall, these\nresults are promising. However, phase 3 randomized trials are neces-\nsary to evaluate the efficacy and safety RMC‐6236 compared to cur-\nrent SOC.\nLast, several other tri‐complex inhibitors are entering the clinic,\nand data regarding efficacy are pending. For instance, RM‐018 a\nnovel, tri‐complex KRAS ON inhibitor, can overcome resistance to\nRAS OFF inhibitors by inhibiting KRASG12C and as well as a novel,\nsecondary mutation KRAS Y96D affecting the switch‐II pocket.47\nLast, several other RAS ON small molecule inhibitors targeting G12D\nor other variants, including KRAS G13C, are being tested, and more\nin‐depth analysis of efficacy and toxicity is needed before concluding\nif they can be used in clinical settings48 (Figure 1).\nRESISTANCE MECHANISM TO KRASG12C\nINHIBITION\nContrary to EGFR and ALK inhibitors in NSCLC, sotorasib, and\nadagrasib do not provide frequent and durable responses, suggesting\nthe presence of intrinsic tumor resistance.49,50 Acquired resistance\nmechanism to KRASG12C inhibitors can be categorized into two major\nmechanisms: on‐target resistance, such as secondary KRAS alter-\nations, or off‐target resistance, which includes upstream, down-\nstream,\nor\nparallel\nbypass\nmechanisms,\nchanges\nin\ntumor\nmicroenvironment (TME), and histological transformation.\nConcurrent KRAS alterations\nDe novo secondary KRAS mutations or amplifications are present in\n2.8% of cancers and potentially lead KRASG12C inhibitors resis-\ntance.50,51,52,53 Second site non‐G12C mutations such as G12D/V/R,\nG13D, and Q61H, as well as allelic rearrangement from G12C to\nG12W, can also induce acquired drug resistance. KRASG12C mutant\ntumors treated with sotorasib led to treatment‐emergent alterations\nin 27 of 43 patients, including second site KRAS mutations and copy\nnumber\ngains.50\nPlasma\nbiomarker\nanalysis\nof\nCodeBreak100\nrevealed that acquired genomic alterations at disease progression\nwere heterogeneous and polyclonal, including changes in multiple\ngenes (EGFR, second site RAS, etc.) and RTK pathway dysregulation\nin NSCLC and colorectal cancer.54 Similarly, adagrasib treatment\nresulted in several mutations in the drug binding pocket (Y96C,\nH95R, and H95D), leading to decreased sensitivity to therapy.50,55\nNotably, although H95 alteration showed reduced sensitivity to\nadagrasib, this did not affect sensitivity to sotorasib.\nVertical signaling pathway alteration\nResistance to KRASG12C inhibition can arise from alterations in the\nupstream signaling pathways such as SHP2, SOS, and RTKs and can\nlead to both adaptive and acquired resistance. Upregulation in up-\nstream RTKs like EGFR, HER2, and MET leads to increased frequency\nof KRASG12C in the GTP bound form and MAPK signaling resulting in\nresistance to both sotorasib and adagrasib therapy.56 Adaptive\nresistance is characterized by the rapid rebound activation of the\nRAS‐MAPK pathway due to the induction of genes encoding RTKs\nand their ligands on inhibition of RAS signaling. Therefore, inhibiting\nupstream effector pathways, such as SHP2 and SOS1, reduces the\nactivation of KRASG12C mutant cancer cells.57,58 Furthermore, MET\namplification, a common bypass mechanism in several oncogene‐\ndriven NSCLCs treated with TKIs, has also been observed in pa-\ntients with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC treated with KRASG12C in-\nhibitors.59 Interestingly, these tumors do not generally have a\npolygenic resistance mechanism.50 Emerging treatment approaches\nwith concomitant inhibition of KRASG12C and upstream RTKs or\nother proteins such as SHP2 and SOS1 to bypass intrinsic drugs are\nunder active investigation.60\nAdditional resistance mechanisms\nParallel pathways can bypass KRASG12C inhibition via different\nmechanisms, including changes in the cell‐cycle regulation, pheno-\ntypic transformation, or modification of the TME. Histological\nSHAVERDASHVILI and BURNS\n-\n7 of 11\ntransformation, a well‐described off‐target resistance mechanism to\nmultiple targeted therapies, was also described in patients treated\nwith adagrasib.50 Last, changes in TME, increased TGF‐β signaling,\nEMT transformation, and neoangiogenesis contribute to resistance.61\nIn summary, diverse on‐ and off‐target mechanisms can lead to\nKRASG12C inhibitors resistance, and several resistance mechanisms\ncan frequently be present simultaneously. For example, one rapid\nautopsy case report of a patient with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC\ntreated with sotorasib identified several resistance mechanisms in\ntumors, including decreased KRASG12C allele frequency, reactivation\nof MAPK pathway, and evidence of tumor immunologic evasion.61\nThus, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes in\npatients with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC who experience disease\nrelapse. Several ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating the\ncombination of adagrasib and sotorasib with inhibitors of other RTK\n(e.g., MEKi trametinib and EGFRi panitumumab) or SHP2 (TNO155a,\nSHP2i). Moreover, the development of additional KRASG12C in-\nhibitors with different mechanisms of action and alternative allele\nspecificities is necessary to overcome emerging on‐target resistance\nmechanisms. Last, combining two distinct classes of direct KRAS in-\nhibitors could have an advantage in preventing both second site\nmutations and rebound activation of the RAS signaling pathway.\nKRASG12C INHIBITOR THERAPY COMBINATION\nSTRATEGIES\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the care of\nmultiple tumors, including NSCLC, and are first‐line treatment for\nnononcogenic driver metastatic NSCLC, including patients with\nKRASG12C mutant tumors. Oncogenic KRAS‐driven tumors are char-\nacterized by immunosuppressive TME and reduced activity of tumor‐\ninfiltrating T cells. On the contrary, inhibition of KRAS has been\nassociated with augmented cytotoxic T‐cell tumor infiltration.48,62,63\nThus, there has been an emerging excitement in leveraging the syn-\nergistic effects of KRAS inhibition with ICIs in patients with advanced\nKRASG12C mutant NSCLC to improve treatment outcomes. Preclinical\nstudies have demonstrated that combining sotorasib with anti–PD‐1\ntherapy increases CD8þ T‐cell infiltration and augmented antitumor\nimmunity.48,64,65 Unfortunately, early clinical data from studies\ninvestigating combination strategies of KRASG12C inhibitors with\nanti–PD(L)‐1 in patients with NSCLC has shown significant chal-\nlenges mainly associated with increased TRAEs, most notably hepa-\ntotoxicity. Early reports from the CodeBreak100/101 study raised\nconcerns that the combination of sotorasib with ICI was associated\nwith a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity compared to\nsotorasib monotherapy.5 Severe sotorasib‐related liver toxicity has\nalso been observed in patients with prior ICI use, and one study\nrecommended delaying sotorasib therapy 30 days after ICI admin-\nistration.66‐68 Other ongoing studies with other KRASG12C inhibitors\nsuggest that combining KRASG12C inhibitors with ICIs may be\nfeasible. The phase 2 KRYSTAL‐7 study evaluated adagrasib and\npembrolizumab in treatment‐naive patients with KRASG12C mutant\nNSCLC and PD‐L1 greater than or equal to 50%.69 This combination\ntherapy led to an improved ORR of 63%, particularly in patients with\nTPS greater than or equal to 50%. In contrast to sotorasib data,\nadagrasib led to mainly low‐grade hepatotoxicity and a more\nmanageable toxicity profile, although ~50% of patients experienced\neither drug‐dose reduction or interruption due to TRAEs. Adagrasib,\nin combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, is further\nbeing tested in a phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05609578).\nPreliminary data of a novel oral KRASG12C inhibitor, MK‐1084, in\ncombination with pembrolizumab, demonstrated antitumor efficacy\nand manageable safety profile in treatment‐naive KRASG12C mutant\nNSCLC.70 Currently, the MK‐1084 and pembrolizumab combination\nis being evaluated in phase 3 trials in patients with PD‐L1 positive\n(TPS greater than or equal to 50%), KRASG12C mutant NSCLC\n(NCT06345729). Additionally, the LOXO‐RAS‐20001, a phase 1/2\nstudy, evaluated olomorasib, a highly selective second‐generation\ninhibitor of KRASG12C, in combination with pembrolizumab in\nKRASG12C\nmutant\nNSCLC\nacross\nany\nline\nof\ntreatment\n(NCT04956640).71 Results presented at ASCO 2024 demonstrated\nthat among the 60 efficacy‐evaluable patients with NSCLC harboring\nKRASG12C, olomorasib in combination with pembrolizumab demon-\nstrated an ORR of 77% in treatment‐naive patients (n = 17) and 40%\nin previously treated patients, including those that progressed on\nprior\nchemotherapy,\nimmunotherapy,\nprior\nKRASG12C\ninhibitor\n(n = 43), and showed a favorable safety profile.71 A global registra-\ntional study, SUNRAY‐01, is currently investigating the combination\nof olomorasib with pembrolizumab or chemoimmunotherapy in the\nfirst‐line NSCLC (NCT06119581). Despite the promising results from\nthe above studies, the combination of KRASG12C inhibitors with ICIs\nmay pose a higher risk for toxicity and will require larger phase 3\ntrials to define the safety of these combinations.\nThe use of concurrent chemotherapy to debulk tumors and\nprevent secondary mutation emergence has been explored in several\nstudies. The CodeBreak100 evaluated the combination of sotorasib\nwith pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with KRASG12C mutant\nNSCLC and showed ORR of 65% and 54% in the first‐ and second‐\nline settings, respectively.72 Additionally, phase 2 SCARLET study\nshowed that sotorasib combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin\nelicited an ORR of 88% in patients with KRASG12C mutant NSCLC.73\nThe phase 3 Code‐Break202 trial is currently evaluating sotorasib in\ncombination with platinum doublet chemotherapy versus pem-\nbrolizumab with a platinum doublet in the frontline settings in pa-\ntients\nwith\nPD‐L1\nnegative,\nKRASG12C\nmutant\nNSCLC.\nLast,\nreactivation of the EGFR pathway has been observed as an adaptive\nresponse to KRASG12C inhibition, and the combination of adagrasib\nand cetuximab has been associated with enhanced clinical benefit in\npatients with metastatic colorectal cancer.74 A phase 2 KROCUS\nstudy evaluated efficacy of KRASG12C inhibitors fulzerasib in combi-\nnation with cetuximab, in patients with metastatic NSCLC in the first\nline settings (NCT05756153).75 The results demonstrated ORR was\n80.0% and DCR was 100%. Additionally, five of seven patients with\nBM demonstrated partial response. Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in five\npatients (18.5%), and no grade 4/5 TRAEs were observed.75\n8 of 11\n-\nADVANCES IN KRASG12C NSCLC TREATMENT\nDISCUSSION\nDespite decades of failed attempts to target KRAS, there have been\nsubstantial advances in treating KRASG12C mutant NSCLC. Two\nKRASG12C inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib, are currently approved\nin the second‐line settings for these patients. Furthermore, many\nnext‐generation KRASG12C inhibitors and agents targeting other\nmutant variants or WT KRAS are currently being tested in preclinical\nand clinical studies. However, the efficacy of existing KRASG12C in-\nhibitors is short‐lived with rapid emergence of drug resistance.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and plasticity of RAS signaling\npathways, resistance mechanisms can be heterogeneous, and several\nresistance mechanisms can be present simultaneously, representing a\nsignificant hurdle when selecting treatment for these patients.\nOne promising approach to address primary and acquired\nresistance is using multi‐agent treatment strategies with combination\ntherapies. Combining KRASG12C inhibitors with ICIs to augment\ntreatment response or tumor debulking strategies using systemic\nchemotherapy or drugs targeting KRAS upstream or downstream\nsignaling pathways may effectively target emerging co‐mutations and\nbypass track pathways. Introducing these combinations in the first\nline or eventually in the early‐stage setting may also improve out-\ncomes. Several clinical trials are currently investigating KRASG12C\ninhibitors in first‐line settings. Additionally, the CodeBreak202 study\nis exploring the combination of sotorasib with chemotherapy versus\nchemoimmunotherapy in PD‐L1 negative, KRASG12C mutant NSCLC\n(NCT05920356). Several novel strategies targeting KRAS are being\nexplored in various cancer types. A phase 1 study of mRNA‐5671/\nV941 vaccine, which targets multiple KRAS mutations (G12C, G12D,\nG12V, and G13D) is currently evaluating safety and tolerability of\nmRNA‐5671/V941 as monotherapy or in combination with pem-\nbrolizumab in patients with advanced solid malignancies including\nNSCLC (NCT03948763). Additionally, T‐cell receptor gene targeting\nof KRAS mutations or proteolysis‐targeted chimeras to target KRAS\nG12C mutations such as PROTACs may offer a promising a thera-\npeutic alternative in patients harboring KRAS alterations.76\nFinally, newer RAS‐ON inhibitors are either in clinical trials or\nadvanced stages of preclinical development and may eventually\nsurpass the RAS‐OFF inhibitors. It will be interesting to follow the\nefficacy, safety, and resistance mechanisms of these inhibitors as they\nmature in the clinic. Furthermore, moving KRASG12C inhibitors in the\nneoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in monotherapy or combination\nwith ICIs is also being explored in resectable KRASG12C mutant\nNSCLC (NCT05472623, NCT04302025). In summary, significant\nprogress has been made in treating KRASG12C mutant NSCLC. How-\never, we are likely only scratching the surface of what is possible for\nthe treatment of these patients.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nKhvaramze\nShaverdashvili:\nConceptualization,\nwriting—original\ndraft, and writing—review and editing.

The KRAS-G12C mutation, occurring in approximately 14% of lung adenocarcinomas, has emerged\nas a critical target for precision medicine strategies. While KRAS-G12C inhibitors, including sotorasib and adagrasib, have shown\npromise in clinical trials, their efﬁcacy is limited by primary and acquired resistance mechanisms. This study explored the potential\nof combining anlotinib, a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with KRAS-G12C inhibitors to overcome these resistance challenges\nin NSCLC treatment. Our results demonstrated that anlotinib improved the sensitivity to KRAS-G12C inhibitors in primary and\nacquired resistance settings, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the combination therapy inhibited c-Myc/ORC2 signaling,\nleading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These ﬁndings suggest that the combination of anlotinib and KRAS-G12C inhibitors\nrepresents a promising novel therapeutic approach for KRAS-G12C-mutant NSCLC.\nCell Death and Disease  (2025) 16:356 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-025-07687-w\nINTRODUCTION\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a signiﬁcant global\nhealth burden, accounting for a substantial portion of cancer-\nrelated deaths worldwide [1]. One of the most promising\ndevelopments in NSCLC treatment is the targeting of KRAS\nmutations, which occur in 20–25% of cases and have historically\nbeen regarded as “undruggable”, particularly the KRAS-G12C\nmutation [2–4]. The KRAS-G12C mutation is present in approxi-\nmately 14% of lung adenocarcinomas, establishing it as a critical\ntarget for precision medicine approaches [5, 6]. The development\nof KRAS-G12C inhibitors (KRAS-G12Ci), such as sotorasib and\nadagrasib,\nhave\nshown\npromising\nresults\nin\nclinical\ntrials,\ndemonstrating moderate beneﬁts for previously treated KRAS-\nG12C mutant NSCLC patients, although overall survival remains\nunimproved [7, 8].\nThe efﬁcacy of KRAS-G12Ci is constrained by both primary and\nacquired resistance mechanisms [9]. Primary resistance, observed\nin about 60% of patients, may be attributed to a lack of\ndependency on KRAS signaling [10]. Acquired resistance often\ninvolves adaptive non-mutational reprogramming and the feed-\nback reactivation of compensatory signaling pathways [10–12]. To\naddress these challenges, combination therapies targeting multi-\nple pathways have been proposed, which involves the combina-\ntion\nof\nKRAS-G12C\ninhibitors\nwith\nagents\nthat\ntarget\ncomplementary pathways or resistance mechanisms [12, 13]. In\nthis context, anlotinib has emerged as a promising candidate for\ncombination therapy.\nAnlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has\ndemonstrated signiﬁcant antitumor activity across various cancer\ntypes [14]. It primarily targets vascular endothelial growth factor\nreceptor, ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth\nfactor receptor, and c-Kit [14, 15]. Anlotinib has demonstrated\nefﬁcacy in clinical trials for NSCLC, particularly in patients who have\nprogressed following standard therapies [16]. Its capacity to inhibit\nmultiple pathways involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis\nrenders it an attractive option for combination strategies.\nIn this study, we evaluated the antitumor effects of combining\nanlotinib with KRAS-G12Ci. Our results reveal that this combina-\ntion inhibits c-Myc/origin recognition complex subunit 2 (ORC2)\nsignaling, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and exerts\npotent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo under both primary\nand acquired KRAS-G12Ci resistance conditions. These ﬁndings\nestablish the combination therapy as a promising clinical strategy\nfor overcoming KRAS-G12Ci resistance.\nMETHODS\nCell lines and cell culture\nSix NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS-G12C mutations (H2122, H2030, H358,\nH23, SW1573, and Calu-1) were used in this study. H2122 and H2030 were\npurchased from Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology (Shanghai, China); H358\nand H23 were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of\nSciences (Shanghai, China); and SW1573 and Calu-1 were acquired from the\nCentral Laboratory of Shanghai Chest Hospital.

All compounds were stored\nat −20 °C and diluted to working concentrations immediately before use.\nThe primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: Cyclin B1\n(Proteintech, 55004-1-AP), Cyclin E1 (Proteintech, 11554-1-AP), Cyclin D1\n(Proteintech, 60186-1-Ig), CDK2 (Proteintech, 60312-1-Ig), GAPDH (Protein-\ntech, HRP-60004), Mcl-1 (Proteintech, 16225-1-AP), Bcl-2 (Proteintech,\n12789-1-AP), Bax (ABclonal, A19684), Bid (ABclonal, A23234), p-Erk1/2 (Cell\nSignaling Technology, 4370), Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 4695),\np-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, 4060), Akt (Cell Signaling Technology,\n4691), β-actin (ABclonal, AC006), c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, 5605),\nCOPS5 (ABclonal, A4087), eIF4E (ABclonal, A2162), ORC2 (Abcam, A15697).\nCell viability and cell growth assay in 2D culture\nCell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo\nLaboratories). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3–5 × 103 cells\nper well and treated with indicated compounds for 72 h. Following treatment,\ncells were incubated with CCK-8 reagent for 1 and 2 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was\nmeasured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Cell growth was monitored\nusing the IncuCyte Zoom Live-Cell Analysis System (Essen BioScience).\nSynergism analysis\nDrug combination effects were quantiﬁed using mutiple methods. For\nChou-Talalay method, combination index (CI) values were calculated using\nCompuSyn software (Version 1.0). CI values were interpreted as follows:\nCI < 1.0 indicating synergism, CI = 1.0 indicating additivity, and CI > 1.0\nindicating antagonism. For ZIP, HSA, Bliss, and Loewe score analysis, the\nSynergyﬁnder R package (Zheng S, Wang W, Aldahdooh J 2022) was used\naccording to user tutorial. Synergy score was interpreted as follows:\nSynergy score < −10 indicating antagonism; −10 < Synergy score < 10\nindicating additivity, and Synergy score > 10 indicating synergism.\nColony formation assay\nFor assessment of long-term cell survival and proliferation capacity, cells were\nseeded at low density (1000 cells/well in six-well plates or 200 cells/well in 96-well\nplates) and cultured for 14 days with regular medium changes every 3 days.\nFollowing the culture period, medium was aspirated, and colonies were ﬁxed\nwith 4% polyoxymethylene for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed colonies were\nstained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 30 min. After gentle washing with PBS\nto remove excess stain, plates were air-dried and photographed. Colony number\nand size were quantiﬁed using ImageJ software (NIH, v1.54).\nWound healing assay\nCells were seeded into 96-well plates at ~80%–90% conﬂuency overnight,\nand scratch was then made with IncuCyte Wound Maker 96-Tool (Essen\nBioscience). After removing detached cells, fresh medium containing\nindicated compounds was replenished. Wound conﬂuence was monitored\nand analyzed using IncuCyte Zoom Live-Cell Analysis System.\nCell cycle and apoptosis analysis\nFor cell cycle analysis, cells were incubated with 10 μM EdU in RPMI 1640 for\n3 h using the EdU Cell Proliferation Kit with Alexa Fluor 647 (CX004, Epizyme).\nFollowing ﬁxation with polyoxymethylene and permeabilization with 0.5%\nTriton X-100, cells were stained with EdU-Alexa Fluor 647 and propidium\niodide (PI) using the Cell Cycle Staining Kit (CCS012, MultiSciences). Analysis\nwas performed using an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).\nFor apoptosis detection, cells were double-stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI\nusing the Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Kit (AT101, MultiSciences) according to\nmanufacturer’s instructions. Early apoptotic cells were deﬁned as Annexin V-\npositive/PI-negative, while late apoptotic cells were Annexin V-positive/PI-\npositive. Results were analyzed using Flowjo software (FlowJo LLC, v10.8.1).\nWestern blotting\nTotal protein was extracted using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease\nand phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using the\nbicinchoninic acid assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10%\nSDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked\nwith 5% non-fat milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, followed by\novernight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. Membranes were then\nincubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Protein bands were visualized using an electrochemilumines-\ncence imager. Results were analyzed in Image Studio software (LI-COR).\nTranscriptome sequencing (RNA-seq)\nThe total RNA of three replicates was isolated using TRIzol Reagent\n(Invitrogen).\nLibrary\nconstruction\nand\npaired-end\nsequencing\nwere\nperformed on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. Raw sequencing data\nwere quality-controlled and mapped to the human reference genome\n(GRCh38). Differential expression analysis was conducted using the DESeq2\nR package (Love MI, Huber W, Anders S 2014), and pathway enrichment\nanalysis was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)\nsoftware (UC San Diego and Broad Institute, v4.1.0). Differentially\nexpressed genes were deﬁned as |log2FC| > 2 and adjusted p-val < 0.05.\nRNA extraction and quantitative PCR\nTotal RNA of was extracted using FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation\nKit (RC112-01, Vazyme) following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and\nconcentration were assessed using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer\n(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using HiScript\nIV All-in-One Ultra RT SuperMix (R433-01, Vazyme). Real-time PCR was\nperformed using Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Q712-02,\nVazyme) on a LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche).

Liu et al.\n2\nCell Death and Disease  (2025) 16:356 \nPlasmid and siRNA transfection\nCells were seeded in six-well plates at 40–50% conﬂuency and cultured\novernight. For plasmid transfection, DNA was mixed with Lipofectamine\n3000 and P3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nPlasmid for human MYC (NM_002467.6) was constructed by GeneChem\n(Shanghai,\nChina).\nFor\nsmall\ninterfering\nRNA\n(siRNA)\ntransfection,\noligonucleotides (20 μM) were mixed with Lipofectamine 3000. After 72 h\nof transfection, cells were reseeded into six-well or 96-well plates for\nsubsequent experiments. Transfection efﬁciency was validated by western\nblot analysis.\nThe ORC2 siRNA sequences from 5ʹ to 3ʹ were as follows:\nsi-ORC2 #1: GGUUCAACAUUGUGCUUUATT\nsi-ORC2 #2: CCUGUUGAUAAUGGAACAUTT\nCell-derived xenograft (CDX) assay and in vivo treatment\nFive-week-old nu/nu female athymic mice were subcutaneously injected\nwith 1 × 107 cells suspended in 100 μl PBS into the ﬂank region. Tumor\ndimensions were measured every 3 and 4 days using digital calipers, and\ntumor volume was calculated using the formula: volume = length ×\nwidth2 × 0.5. When tumors reached approximately 200 mm3, mice were\nrandomized into four treatment groups. For H23 CDX, mice were treated\nwith vehicle, sotorasib (60 mg/kg, daily), anlotinib (2 mg/kg, daily) or\ncombination (sotorasib plus anlotinib) through intragastric administra-\ntion. For H2122SR CDX, mice were treatment with vehicle, sotorasib\n(100 mg/kg, daily), anlotinib (2 mg/kg, daily) or combination (sotorasib\nplus anlotinib). Sotorasib was dissolved in 1% Tween 80, 2% HPMC and\n97% water, and anlotinib was dissolved in water. Mice were euthanized\nwhen tumors exceeded 1500 mm3 or at experiment endpoint. Tumors\nwere harvested, weighed, photographed, and ﬁxed in polyoxymethylene\nfor 24 h for subsequent analysis. All procedures were performed with the\napproval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of\nShanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.\nImmunohistochemistry\nFixed tumor tissues were parafﬁn-embedded and sectioned. Tissue\nsections underwent antigen retrieval and endogenous peroxidase block-\nade, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies\nagainst Ki-67, c-Myc, or ORC2. Sections were scanned using an Ocus 20\nMicroscope Slide Scanner (Grundium) and analyzed using QuPath software\n(v0.5.1) for quantitative assessment.\nTissue microarray (TMA) analysis\nA tissue microarray (TMA) containing samples from 80 NSCLC patients was\nobtained from Changsha Yaxiang Biotechnology Co., LTD, along with\ncorresponding clinical characteristics and survival data. The study was\napproved by the company’s Life Sciences Ethics Committee (query code:\nPZEU12C6DYBMQT). TMA sections were immunohistochemically stained\nfor c-Myc and ORC2. Stained sections were analyzed using QuPath\nsoftware (v0.5.1) for quantitative assessment of protein expression.\nStatistics\nQuantitative data from in vitro and in vivo assays are presented as\nmean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical differences between\ngroups were determined using two-tailed Student’s t-test for comparisons\nbetween two groups, or one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nfollowed by appropriate post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons. Pearson\nanalysis was performed in correlation analysis. All statistical analyses and\ngraphical representations were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 soft-\nware. For clinical data analysis, survival curves were generated using the\nKaplan–Meier method. Statistical differences in survival were assessed\nusing the log-rank test. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsigniﬁcant.\nRESULTS\nAnlotinib enhances the sensitivity to KRAS-G12Ci of primary\nand acquired resistant cells in vitro\nTo explore the effects of anlotinib combined with KRAS-G12Ci in\nKRAS-G12Ci resistance settings, we ﬁrst investigated the inhibitory\nefﬁcacy of sotorasib across different NSCLC cell lines harboring\nKRAS-G12C mutations. The sensitivity to sotorasib varied sig-\nniﬁcantly among cell lines: H358, H2122, and H2030 showed high\nsensitivity, while H23, Calu-1, and SW1573 maintained viability\neven at high sotorasib concentrations (Fig. S1A). Based on these\nresults, H23, Calu-1, and SW1573 were classiﬁed as primary\nresistant cell lines.\nTo study acquired resistance, we established acquired resistant\ncell lines (H2122SR and H2030SR) by exposing H2122 and H2030\ncells\nto\nincreasing\nconcentrations\nof\nsotorasib\n(Fig.\nS1B).\nResistance was conﬁrmed through cell viability assays (Fig. S1C,\nD). Notably, both primary and acquired resistant cell lines\nmaintained sensitivity to anlotinib (Fig. S1E), and H2122SR and\nH2030SR were slightly more sensitive to anlotinib (Fig. S1F).\nCell viability assays and synergy analysis revealed that anlotinib\ndose-dependently enhanced sotorasib’s effects in all ﬁve resistant\ncell\nlines\n(H23,\nCalu-1,\nSW1573,\nH2122SR,\nH2030SR),\nwith\nsynergistic effects observed across most concentration combina-\ntions (Figs. 1A, B, S2A–E, and Supplementary Table 1). Similar\neffects were observed when anlotinib was combined with another\nKRAS-G12C inhibitor, adagrasib (Fig. S2I, J). The combination\nsigniﬁcantly suppressed cell growth compared to either agent\nalone (Figs. 1C, D and S2F–H). Colony formation assays demon-\nstrated that anlotinib enhanced sotorasib’s inhibition of long-term\ncell survival (Figs. 1E, F and S2K, L). Additionally, wound healing\nassays showed the combination more effectively inhibited cell\nmigration in resistant cell lines (Figs. 1G–J and S2M–P). These\nﬁndings collectively demonstrate that anlotinib enhances KRAS-\nG12Ci’s antitumor effects in both primary and acquired resistant\nsettings in vitro.\nAnlotinib combined with KRAS-G12Ci induces cell cycle arrest\nand apoptosis in primary and acquired resistant cells\nTo further characterize the mechanisms underlying the combi-\nnation treatment’s efﬁcacy, we examined its effects on cell cycle\nprogression and apoptosis in resistant NSCLC cell lines. Cell\ncycle analysis revealed distinct patterns of arrest between\nprimary and acquired resistant lines. In primary resistant cell\nlines, the combination treatment induced signiﬁcant G1 phase\narrest, while acquired resistant lines showed both G1 and G2/M\nphase arrest. Both scenarios resulted in markedly reduced S\nphase populations compared to single-agent treatments (Figs.\n2A–D and S3A, B). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that the\ncombination treatment more effectively suppressed key cell\ncycle regulators, including Cyclin B1, Cyclin E1, Cyclin D1, and\nCDK2, though the pattern of inhibition varied among cell lines\n(Fig. 2I).\nTime-course analysis of apoptosis demonstrated that the\ncombination treatment induced signiﬁcantly higher apoptosis\nrates compared to single agents, with effects increasing over time\n(Figs. 2E–H and S3C, D). Mechanistically, the enhanced apoptotic\nresponse correlated with suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins\n(Mcl-1 and Bcl-2) rather than changes in pro-apoptotic proteins\n(Bax and Bid) (Fig. 2J). These ﬁndings demonstrate that anlotinib\ncombined with KRAS-G12Ci effectively overcomes both primary\nand acquired resistance through dual mechanisms: inducing cell\ncycle arrest with consequent S phase reduction and promoting\nrobust apoptotic responses.\nThe sensitization effect of anlotinib on resistant cells is\nmediated through inhibition of c-Myc\nTo elucidate the mechanism underlying the enhanced antitumor\neffects, we ﬁrst investigated changes in classical RAS signaling in\nresistant cell lines. While sotorasib maintained its ability to inhibit\np-Erk signiﬁcantly, it showed minimal effects on p-Akt, and\nanlotinib did not produce additional effects on RAS signaling\n(Fig. S4A).\nH.

Liu et al.\n4\nCell Death and Disease  (2025) 16:356 \nTranscriptome analysis of primary sensitive versus resistant cell\nlines using the CCLE database [17] revealed multiple enriched\nmalignancy-related pathways in resistant cells, including EMT, E2F\ntargets, G2M checkpoint, and MYC targets (Figs. 3A and S4B).\nSimilarly, GSEA of an adagrasib-resistant SW837 (KRAS-G12C\nmutant colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) CDX model [18] also\nsuggested that MYC targets were among top enriched pathways\ncompared to treatment naïve tumors (Fig. S4C).\nRNA-seq comparison between H2122 and its resistant counter-\npart H2122SR identiﬁed 902 upregulated and 1601 downregu-\nlated genes (Fig. 3B). GSEA analysis highlighted MYC targets V1,\nMYC targets V2, and oxidative phosphorylation as the top three\nsigniﬁcantly enriched pathways in H2122SR (Figs. 3C and S4D).\nTranscriptome analysis of H2122SR cells after 24-h treatment\nwith sotorasib, anlotinib, or their combination revealed enrich-\nment of various pathways in combination-treated cells, including\nTNF-α signaling via NF-κB, MYC targets V1, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR\nsignaling (Figs. 3D, E and S4E).\nThe combination treatment further downregulated MYC target\npathways compared to single-agent treatments (Fig. 3F). qPCR\nand Western blot analysis conﬁrmed signiﬁcantly elevated MYC\nexpression in H2122SR and H2030SR compared to parental lines in\nboth mRNA and protein levels (Figs. 4A and S4F), while the\ncombination treatment effectively suppressed the mRNA and\nprotein levels of MYC across all resistant cell lines (Figs.\n4B and S4G). Notably, MYC overexpression reduced the sensitivity\nof resistant cells to sotorasib; however, combining anlotinib with\nsotorasib effectively reversed the impact of MYC overexpression\non cell viability (Fig. 4C, D), and long-term survival (Fig. 4E–H).

While MYC overexpression\nupregulated all three targets at the mRNA level (Fig. S4I), only\nORC2\nexpression\nwas\nelevated\nin\nH2122SR\nand\nH2030SR\ncompared to parental lines (Fig. 5B). Proteasome inhibition\nexperiments\nrevealed\nthat\nMG132\nstabilized\nc-Myc\nprotein\nexpression. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of anlotinib, either\nalone or in combination with sotorasib, were partially reversed,\nindicating that these effects were mediated, at least in part, by a\nreduction in protein stability as well (Fig. S4J).\nAnalysis of TCGA datasets (154 KRAS-mutant NSCLC patients)\nrevealed that high MYC expression correlated with poor overall\nsurvival (Fig. S4K) [19]. Notably, ORC2 expression positively correlated\nwith MYC expression (Fig. S4L), and patients with high co-expression\nof both genes showed the worst survival outcomes (Fig. 5C).\nORC2, as part of the DNA replication initiator complex, functions\nalongside other ORC subunits (ORC1-6) to mediate DNA replica-\ntion, playing a crucial role in carcinogenesis [20]. As expected,\ncombination treatment suppressed the protein expression of\nORC2 (Fig. 5D). ORC2 knockdown (Fig. S5A) restored sotorasib\nsensitivity from MYC-OE-induced resistance in H2122 and H2030\nparental cell lines (Fig. 5E). Overexpression of MYC upregulated\nORC2 in mRNA and protein levels (Figs. S4I and S5A), and ORC2\nknockdown reversed the protective effects of MYC overexpression\nagainst combination treatment, restoring cell cycle arrest and\napoptosis in H23 and H2122SR cells (Figs. 5F–I, and S5B–E).\nSimilarly, ORC2 knockdown reinstated the combination treat-\nment’s inhibitory effects on tumor growth and viability in MYC-\noverexpressing cells (Fig. 5J–M).\nThese ﬁndings establish the c-Myc/ORC2 axis as a critical\nmediator of response to anlotinib combined with KRAS-G12Ci in\novercoming resistance.\nAnlotinib combined with KRAS-G12Ci exerts potent tumor\nsuppression in resistant settings in vivo\nTo validate our in vitro ﬁndings, we evaluated the combination\ntreatment’s efﬁcacy in vivo using H23 and H2122SR CDX models.\nWhile single-agent sotorasib showed limited efﬁcacy, the combi-\nnation treatment demonstrated potent tumor growth suppression\nwithout signiﬁcant effects on body weight in both models (Figs.\n6A–H and S5F, G).\nImmunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues revealed that\nthe combination treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the expression\nof Ki-67 (proliferation marker), c-Myc, and ORC2 in both H23 and\nH2122SR xenografts (Fig. 6I–L).\nSupporting these ﬁndings, TMA analysis demonstrated a\npositive correlation between ORC2 and c-Myc protein expression\nlevels. Importantly, high co-expression of c-Myc and ORC2\ncorrelated with worse survival outcomes in NSCLC patients (Fig.\nS5H, I).\nThese in vivo results along with in vitro results validate our\nmechanistic ﬁndings and demonstrate that anlotinib combined\nwith KRAS-G12Ci effectively overcomes resistance through mod-\nulation of the c-Myc/ORC2 axis, resulting in signiﬁcant tumor\nsuppression (Fig. 6M).\nDISCUSSION\nThe emergence of KRAS-G12C inhibitors represents a signiﬁcant\nbreakthrough in NSCLC treatment, yet their clinical efﬁcacy\nremains\nconstrained\nby\nprimary\nand\nacquired\nresistance\nmechanisms [9, 10, 12]. Our study demonstrates that combining\nanlotinib with KRAS-G12C inhibitors effectively overcomes these\nresistance mechanisms through modulation of the c-Myc/\nORC2 signaling axis.\nFig. 3\nTranscriptome analysis revealed that MYC is the key regulator of the antitumor effects of anlotinib combined with KRAS-G12Ci.\nA Enriched hallmark pathways of primary resistant cell lines (Calu-1, SW1573, H23) compared with sensitive cell lines (H358, H2122, H2030).\nNormalized enrichment score (NES) is plotted.

Liu et al.\n6\nCell Death and Disease  (2025) 16:356 \nOur ﬁndings reveal that anlotinib synergistically enhances the\nantitumor effects of KRAS-G12Ci across multiple resistant NSCLC\ncell lines. This synergy is observed in both primary resistant lines\n(H23, Calu-1, SW1573) and acquired resistant lines (H2122SR,\nH2030SR), suggesting a broad applicability of this combination\nstrategy. The enhanced efﬁcacy is manifested through increased\ninhibition of cell viability, long-term survival, and migration,\nindicating\na\nmultifaceted\nimpact\non\ncancer\ncell\nbehavior.\nMechanistically, the combination therapy induces robust cell\ncycle arrest and apoptosis in resistant cell lines.\nTranscriptome analysis and further validation revealed the c-\nMyc/ORC2 axis as a critical mediator of the combination therapy’s\neffects. The downregulation of c-Myc and its downstream target\nORC2 appears to be a key event in the antitumor response. As\npart of the DNA replication initiator complex, ORC2 functions\nalongside other ORC subunits (ORC1-6) to mediate DNA replica-\ntion, playing a crucial role in carcinogenesis [20]. Interestingly, a\nstudy in pancreatic cancer discovered that ORC2 phosphorylation\nby polo-like kinase 1 promotes DNA replication under stress\nconditions and contributes to gemcitabine resistance, suggesting\nits potential importance in cancer progression [21]. Consistent\nwith our in vitro results, the positive correlation between c-Myc\nand ORC2 expression, and their association with worse survival\noutcomes in NSCLC patients, further underscores the clinical\nrelevance of targeting this axis. Previous studies have conﬁrmed\nthe importance of upregulated MYC in KRAS-G12Ci resistance and\nthe potential of targeting c-Myc to improve KRAS-G12Ci efﬁcacy\n[11, 22]. Anlotinib has been shown to directly target c-Myc in\nmultiple myeloma [23], and reverse resistance through targeting\nthe c-MET/MYC/AXL axis in NSCLC [24]. These ﬁndings strengthen\nour study’s results of the inhibitory effects of anlotinib combined\nwith KRAS-G12Ci by targeting c-Myc/ORC2 axis in KRAS-G12Ci\nresistant settings. Clinical responses to anlotinib combination\ntreatment in KRAS-mutant patients have been reported in\nmultiple cancer types, especially NSCLC [25–28], providing\nevidence for the potential application of our combined strategy.\nFig. 4\nThe sensitization effect of anlotinib on resistant cells is mediated through inhibition of c-Myc.

Liu et al.\n7\nCell Death and Disease  (2025) 16:356 \nThe in vivo studies corroborate our in vitro ﬁndings, demonstrat-\ning potent tumor suppression in both primary resistant (H23) and\nacquired resistant (H2122SR) xenograft models. The signiﬁcant\nreduction in tumor growth, coupled with decreased expression of\nKi-67, c-Myc, and ORC2 in tumor tissues, provides the evidence for\nthe translational potential of this combination therapy.\nAnlotinib has been approved by the NMPA since 2018 as a\nthird-line or subsequent treatment option for patients with NSCLC\nin China, demonstrating a favorable safety proﬁle as monotherapy\nin the ALTER0303 trial. Real-world studies have further conﬁrmed\nthat adverse events associated with anlotinib, whether adminis-\ntered alone or in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, are manage-\nable in lung cancer and other malignancies [29–32]. Additionally,\nmultiple clinical trials have demonstrated anlotinib’s potential as a\nsafe and effective candidate when combined with PD-1 inhibitors\nor EGFR-TKIs, signiﬁcantly\nprolonging PFS\nand\novercoming\nresistance in patients with metastatic NSCLC [33–35]. These\nﬁndings further support the rationale for exploring anlotinib in\ncombination with KRAS-G12C inhibitors as a promising therapeu-\ntic strategy for this patient population.\nHowever, several limitations and future directions should be\nconsidered. While our study focused on NSCLC, the applic-\nability of this combination strategy to other KRAS-G12C mutant\ncancers requires further investigation. Additionally, long-term\nsafety and efﬁcacy of this combination in patients need\nevaluation through clinical trials. Moreover, the mechanism\nunderlying c-Myc inhibition by this combination necessitates\nclariﬁcation. Future studies should explore potential resistance\nmechanisms to this combination therapy and strategies to\novercome them.\nIn conclusion, this study provides a strong rationale for the\nclinical evaluation of anlotinib in combination with KRAS-G12C\ninhibitors in NSCLC patients with primary or acquired resistance to\nKRAS-G12Ci monotherapy. The elucidation of the c-Myc/ORC2 axis\nas a key mediator of response offers new insights into the\nmolecular basis of KRAS-G12Ci resistance and suggests novel\ntherapeutic targets. This combination strategy holds promise for\nimproving outcomes in patients with KRAS-G12C mutant NSCLC,\npotentially extending the beneﬁts of precision medicine to a\nbroader patient population.\nFig. 5\nc-Myc/ORC2 axis is the crucial signaling pathway underlying the response to anlotinib and KRAS-G12Ci combined treatment.\nA Heatmap of the mRNA expression of SNRPD2, RPL22, DEK, EIF4E, COPS5, ORC2, SSB, UBE2E1, AP3S1 in ﬁve cell lines (Calu-1, SW1573, H23,\nH2122SR, and H2030SR) detected by qPCR. n = 3 per group.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-\nactivating proteins (GAPs) regulate the transition from RAS(ON) to\nRAS(OFF) and from RAS(OFF) to RAS(ON) (1). RAS(ON) promotes\nseveral important signaling pathways, primarily the RAS-RAF-MEK-\nERK pathway and the RAS-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, thus playing\nan important role in cell survival and cell cycle proliferation (2).\nGrowth factors can induce rapid dimerization and\nautophosphorylation of their receptors (GFRs). Speciﬁc tyrosine\nresidues in noncatalytic regions of autophosphorylated GFRs can\ninteract with the SH2 domain of the Grb2 protein. Coupled with the\nSon of Sevenless (Sos) protein, the Grb2-Sos complex stimulates the\nexchange of GDP for GTP on RAS, thus leading to RAS(ON)\npromotion. The Grb2-Sos complex is the primary GEF (3, 4).\nEven though RAS possesses intrinsic low GTPase activity,\nadditional proteins are needed to accelerate GTP hydrolysis.\nThose GAPs (such as RASA1, neuroﬁbromin, or DAB2IP) aid,\nvia their arginine ﬁnger, in the structural rearrangement and\nassembly of a catalytically competent active site, leading to\nnucleotide release (4, 5). Regulation of RAS signaling thus\ndepends on a balance between GEFs and GAPs.\nThe RAS(ON) protein binds to RAS binding domains (RBD) located\non RAS effectors, which are proteins with a strong afﬁnity to RAS(ON).\nRAF (rapidly accelerated ﬁbrosarcoma) is a critical RAS effector that\ntriggers the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. PI3K is another important\nRAS effector that activates the RAS-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (4).\nFour isoforms of the RAS protein are found in humans: HRAS,\nNRAS, KRAS4A, and KRAS4B (6), with RAS mutations detected in\n19% of cancer patients (75% in KRAS, 17% in NRAS, and 7% in\nHRAS) (7).\nKRAS mutations are frequent in lung adenocarcinomas, accounting\nfor 43% of cases (8), while NRAS and HRAS mutations account\ncollectively for approximately 1.2% of cases. Furthermore, 80% of\nNSCLC-KRAS mutations involve a glycine on position 12 substitution\n(KRASG12C, KRASG12V, KRASG12D…) and 11% involve a glycine on\nposition 13 substitution (KRASG13C, KRASG13D, KRASG13R…).\nThe most frequent KRAS mutation is KRASG12C, present in 13%\nof lung adenocarcinomas (9). This glycine at position 12\nsubstitution to cysteine in the KRASG12C protein prevents\ninteraction with GAPs through steric blockade, resulting in\nreduced GTPase activity responsible for the accumulation of\nactive KRASG12C-GTP bound protein (KRASG12C(ON)).\nUnlike other oncogenic mutations such as EGFR's classical L858R\nexon 21 mutation or exon 19 deletions, KRAS mutations are\npredominantly seen in the majority of patients with a history of\nsmoking and co-mutations are not rare (mainly TP53, STK11, and\nKEAP1). However, KRAS mutations are considered mutually\nexclusive with other NSCLC driver alterations, such as EGFR\nmutations, EML4-ALK fusions, or ROS1 fusions.\nLong deemed undruggable due to its lack of apparent\nhydrophobic pockets and its picomolar afﬁnity for GTP/GDP,\nnew KRASG12C inhibitors are ﬁnally under investigation in\npreclinical and clinical studies (10). These treatments bind\ncovalently to an H95 residue located in an allosteric binding\npocket behind switch-II, referred to as P2, near the mutated\ncysteine 12, in the inactive KRASG12C-GDP bound protein\n(KRASG12C(OFF) (Figure 1). This covalent binding in the P2\npocket induces the blocking of nucleotide exchange from GDP to\nGTP (10) thereby inhibiting RAS-effector interaction in KRASG12C\nmutant cells. Despite the KRASG12C mutation inducing the\naccumulation of KRASG12C(ON) protein, 25% of proteins in\neach cell remain in a GDP-bound inactive state, explaining the\npotential for protein inhibition (11).\nSotorasib is the ﬁrst-in-class OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitor,\navailable in France since early 2021 through an early access program.\nThe phase III open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) CodeBreak\n200 demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) over\ndocetaxel (median PFS 5.6 months (4.3-7.8) in the sotorasib group\nvs 4.5 months (3.0-5.7) in the docetaxel group; 12-month PFS rate of\n24.8% with sotorasib vs 10.1% with docetaxel) (12). However, the\noverall survival (OS) did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, partly due to\na decrease in sample size after protocol amendment and a 26% cross-\nover rate in the docetaxel group.\nAdagrasib is another OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitor with results\nfrom the recently published phase I/II KRYSTAL-1 study (13) showing\npromising outcomes with adagrasib in the same second-line setting as\nsotorasib. A phase III randomized controlled trial (NCT04685135) is in\nprogress. Additionally, studies investigating sotorasib and adagrasib\n(alone or combined with chemo- or immunotherapy) in the ﬁrst-line\nand the second-line settings are ongoing (34 trials listed on\nclinicaltrials.gov). A summary of the main efﬁcacy results in the\nsecond-line setting is described in Table 1.\nDespite promising efﬁcacy, resistance to OFF-state KRASG12C\ninhibitors occurs in virtually all patients. Notably, one-third of patients\nexperienced early disease progression (PFS < 3 months) on sotorasib in\nthe CodeBreaK100 study. Primary and early adaptative resistance\nmechanisms may drive early disease progression (14). Recent\npreclinical and clinical datasets suggest that resistance mechanisms to\nthe KRASG12C inhibitors sotorasib and adagrasib may be categorized\ninto two distinct groups: genetic and non-genetic mechanisms, which\ncan explain early and delayed resistance at different levels.\nThis review aims to describe and examine emerging\nmechanisms of resistance to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors in\nKRASG12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to\ndemonstrate how this body of data is shaping the therapeutical\ndevelopment in KRASG12C targeting.\n2 Genetic mechanisms of resistance\nto OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors\n2.1 Genetic determinants of\nprimary resistance\nGenomic alterations were correlated with long-term beneﬁt\n(PFS ≥12 months) versus early progression (PFS < 3 months) in\nChour et al.\n10.3389/fonc.2024.1328728\nFrontiers in Oncology\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nthe CodeBreaK100 study dataset (14). The most signiﬁcant\nenrichment in patients with early progression was observed with\nmutant KEAP1. Aggregated with other emerging data, co-occurring\nmutations in KEAP1, SMARCA4, and CDKN2A are associated with\nworse clinical outcomes with sotorasib or adagrasib therapy (14–\n16). The biological mechanisms driving early progression in this\nsubgroup of patients with co-occurring KEAP1, SMARCA4, and\nCDKN2A mutations are not clearly understood.\n2.2 Genetic mechanisms of\nacquired resistance\nMechanisms of acquired resistance have been partly described\nfollowing treatment with sotorasib and adagrasib. Resistance has\nbeen categorized as \"on-target\" or \"off-target\", with the majority of\npublished data focusing on \"on-target\" mechanisms. Figure 2\nsummarizes acquired mechanisms of resistance to OFF-state\nKRASG12C inhibitors (11).\n2.2.1 \"On-target\" genetic mechanisms of\nresistance to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors\n\"On-target\" genetic mechanisms of resistance to OFF-state\nKRASG12C inhibitors encompass mutations of the KRASG12C\ncodon to another mutant variant on the same allele (cis) or a\nsecondary KRAS mutation on the trans-KRAS allele. CfDNA\nanalysis of a 67-year-old patient with KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC\nafter progression on adagrasib showed a new (trans) KRASG12V\nmutation (11), coexisting with the (cis) KRASG12C mutation and\nprobably arising from the wild-type KRAS allele. The persistence of\na wild-type KRAS allele in multiple KRAS-mutated lung cancer cell\nlines was observed in preclinical studies (17). Acquired KRASG12D/R/\nV/W mutations in other patients led to the reactivation of the KRAS\ndownstream pathway (18). Non-KRASG12 mutations affecting\nswitch II pocket and precluding drug binding, such as KRASY96C,\nKRASR68S, or KRASH95D/Q/R, were described (18). Other KRAS\nmutations, like KRASG13D or KRASA59S, induce resistance by\ndecreasing GTP hydrolysis or promoting GDP to GTP nucleotide\nexchange (18).\nKRASG12C allele ampliﬁcation or copy number gain were the\nonly identiﬁable resistance mechanisms in two patients treated with\nadagrasib (18).\nUpstream reactivation of associated proteins such as Aurora Kinase\nA (AURKA), a serine/threonine kinase essentially involved in mitosis\nand DNA repair, has been shown to facilitate effector activation by\nstabilizing the interaction between newly formed KRASG12C protein\nand RAF, thus aiding cell cycle progression in in vitro models (19).\nIn summary, the inhibition of KRASG12C(OFF) downregulates\nphysiological negative feedback mechanisms, leading to the\nupregulation of GFR (19). Similar resistance mechanisms have\nalready been described with MEK inhibitors (20) and BRAF\ninhibitors (21).\nFIGURE 1\nModel of KRASG12C-protein in the inactive GDP-bound state with important domains highlighted. 3D molecule was rendered with ProteinImager\n(http://3dproteinimaging.com) based on the crystal structure (PBD ID: 6OIM, rcsb.org/structure/6OIM). The structure of the KRAS gene comprises a G-\ndomain coding region and a hypervariable region, including the conserved CAAX motif, a membrane anchor sequence (C: cysteine, A: aliphatic amino\nacids, X: any amino acid and residues coding for a lipid tail; not shown here). Selected structural regions of the KRAS protein G-domain are highlighted:\nthe phosphate-binding loop (P-loop, amino acids (aa) 10 to 16) and the two switch regions (switch I (aa 30 to 38) and switch II (aa 59 to 67)). Both switch\nregions change conformation to make hydrogen bonds with the gamma-phosphate in GTP-bound-KRAS. Sotorasib is observed in its binding pocket (P2,\nbehind Switch II region, near mutated Cysteine-12). The mutated Cystein-12 residue is shown in yellow. Adagrasib interacts with the P2 binding pocket in\nthe same way as sotorasib.\nChour et al.\n10.3389/fonc.2024.1328728\nFrontiers in Oncology\nfrontiersin.org\n03\n2.2.2 \"Off-target\" genetic mechanisms of\nresistance to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors\n\"Off-target\" genetic mechanisms of resistance to OFF-state\nKRASF12C inhibitors include:\n- Ampliﬁcations or mutations of upstream RTK genes (such\nas EGFR).\n- Bypass of KRASG12C through activating mutation in\ndownstream pathway components, including MEK, BRAF,\nor PI3KCA.\n- Activating mutation in NRAS or HRAS.\nIn an analysis of 38 patients with KRASG12C-mutant cancers\nresistant to adagrasib (18), a putative resistance mechanism was\nseen in only 17 patients. These mechanisms included multiple\nacquired bypass resistances (such as EGFR, RET, NRAS, BRAF,\nPI3K, and PTEN mutations), acquired gene fusions (e.g., EML4-\nALK), or ampliﬁcation (e.g., MET). An important limitation of this\nstudy was the limited number of tissue samples, with most analyses\nconducted using cfDNA sequencing. Interestingly, multiple co-\nresistance mechanisms were found in patients.\nFor example, one patient developed a KRASG12D and KRASQ61H\nmutation (an \"on-target\" resistance mechanism) associated with a\nBRAFV600E bypass mutation and a CCD6-RET fusion (an \"off-target\"\nresistance mechanism). The MET ampliﬁcation was found in vitro\nto bypass the RAS pathway through the HGF/MET pathway,\nleading to AKT and ERK activation, but also reactivating the\nRAS-BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway through other RAS isoforms (22)\n3 Non-genetic mechanisms of\nresistance to OFF-state\nKRASG12C inhibitors\nA large majority of patients have no identiﬁable genetic\nmechanisms of resistance to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors,\nsuggesting that resistance may arise from non-genetic alterations.\n3.1 Upstream reactivation of growth\nfactor receptors\nRapid adaptative resistance may be driven by GFR reactivation\n(19, 23) The upstream reactivation of GFRs (including multiple\ntyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs)) not only increases KRASG12C\noutput but also activates wild-type KRAS and other RAS isotypes\n(NRAS and HRAS), which can at least partially restore MAPK\nsignaling. This rebound mechanism, with higher concentrations of\nNRAS(ON) and HRAS(ON) and downstream pathway reactivation\n(shown by phosphorylation of downstream MAPK proteins ERK\n(extracellular signal-regulated kinases) and RSK (ribosomal s6\nkinase)), was seen in the ﬁrst 48h following KRASG12C\ninhibition in KRASG12C-mutant cell lines (19). RTKs such as\nEGFR, but also HER2, FGFR, and cMET were activated with\ndifferent levels in different cell lines. RTK reactivation can activate\nTABLE 1\nEfﬁcacy data from Phase II/III trials involving KRASG12C inhibitors sotorasib and adagrasib in pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\nKRASG12C\nInhibitor\nStudy\nPhase\nControl\nNumber of patients\nObjective Responsea\n- %,\n(95% CI)\nMedian duration of\nresponseb, mo\n(95% IC)\nMedian PFS, mo\n(95% IC)\nMedian OS, mo\n(95% IC)\nControl\nKRASG12Ci\nControl\nKRASG12Ci\nControl\nKRASG12Ci\nControl\nKRASG12Ci\nControl\nKRASG12Ci\nSotorasib\nCodeBreak\n100\nII15\n126\n37.1\n(28.6-46.2)\n11.1\n(6.9-NE)\n6.8\n(5.1-8.2)\n12.5\n(10-NE)\nCodeBreak\n200\nIII13\nDocetaxel\n174\n174\n13.2\n(8.6-19.2)\n28.1\n(21.5-35.4)\n6.8\n(4.3-8.3)\n8.6\n(7.1-18.0)\n4.5\n(3.0-5.7)\n5.6\n(4.3-7.8)\n11.3\n(9.0-14.9)\n10.6\n(8.9-14.0)\nAdagrasib\nKrystal-1\nII14\n116\n42.9\n(33.5-52.6)\n8.5\n(6.2-13.8)\n6.5\n(4.7-8.4)\n12.6\n(9.2-19.2)\naObjective response was deﬁned as a complete or partial response.\nbDuration of response was evaluated based on patients with a complete or partial response.

This has been shown in vitro with the\nrapid increase of SHP2 activation in multiple KRAS-mutant lung,\ncolon, and pancreatic cell lines after initial reduction following\nMEK inhibition (23).\n3.2 Histological transdifferentiation and cell\nlineage plasticity\nHistological transdifferentiation and cell lineage plasticity may\nplay a role in the resistance to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors.\nTwo KRASG12C mutant lung adenocarcinomas treated with\nadagrasib showed squamous cell carcinoma histology in biopsies\nat progression, with no genomic alterations explaining the\nresistance otherwise (18). Transcriptomic and genomic analysis\non pre-treatment biopsies from patients in the KRYSTAL-1 trial\nrevealed that patients presenting a baseline high expression of\nsquamous cell carcinoma-related genes and STK11/LKB1 co-\nmutations had a shorter treatment duration with adagrasib (24).\nSTK11/LKB1 co-mutations are frequent in KRASG12C mutant lung\nadenocarcinomas, and LKB1 is a regulator of chromatin\naccessibility linked with cellular plasticity (25, 26). Its inactivation\ninduced squamous transition in KRASG12D-mutant lung\nadenocarcinoma cell lines. In a preclinical study, adagrasib-\nresistant KRAS/LKB1 mutant NSCLC showed enrichment in\nFIGURE 2\nSummary of \"on-target\" and \"off-target\" resistance mechanisms to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors.

The illustration was created with BioRender.com.

In another preclinical study, KRAS inhibition\nwas associated with the transition of lung adenocarcinoma alveolar\ntype 2 cells to alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. AT1 cells exhibited less\ndependency on KRAS and more quiescent activity (27). Both\nmechanisms have been described with EGFR and ALK inhibitors\nin EGFR-mutation-positive and ALK-fusion-positive NSCLC\nmodels (28).\n3.3 Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition\nEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been observed\nin KRASG12C-mutated cancer cell lines after induced resistance to\nsotorasib. EMT, the process by which epithelial cells acquire\nmesenchymal features, is associated in cancer with tumor\ninvasion, initiation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy (29),\nnotably with EGFR and ALK inhibitors in EGFR-mutation-\npositive and ALK-fusion-positive NSCLC models (30, 31). EMT\ncan be induced by numerous biological drivers such as TGFb, TNF-\na, HIF-a, Wnt signaling, interleukins, Hedgehog, and Hippo\npathways (32). Genes related to EMT were enriched in sotorasib-\nresistant NSCLC cell lines (33). Induction of EMT via chronic\nTGFb treatment was sufﬁcient to induce resistance to sotorasib. In\nthis population of EMT-induced cells, rebound activation of ERK\nand S6 was observed. Cell growth was inhibited after the addition of\na PI3K inhibitor to sotorasib, implying that KRASG12C-\nindependent AKT activation is a cause of resistance to sotorasib\nin EMT-induced KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC cell lines. These results\nwere conﬁrmed in a xenograft mouse model. EMT dependence on\nCDK-4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) has also been described in in\nvitro models, with promising efﬁcacy for CDK4 inhibitors in\nreducing tumor volume in a murine model with autochthonous\nmesenchymal-like lung cancer with a KRASG12D mutation (34).\n3.4 Tumor microenvironment\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with KRAS-\nmutant tumor cells is highly immunosuppressive (35). The TME is\ntransiently converted to a less immunosuppressive state following RAS\ninhibition and may increase susceptibility to immunotherapies.\nDue to a lack of data, other non-genomic resistance mechanisms to\nKRASG12C cannot be described to date. For example, no data about\nepigenetic dysregulation in this context are yet available.\n4 Lessons from known mechanisms of\nresistance to OFF-state KRASG12C\ninhibitors and\ntherapeutical perspectives\nCo-mutations in key tumor suppressor genes (KEAP1,\nSMARCA4, and CDKN2A) deﬁne different subgroups of\nKRASG12C-mutant NSCLC with clearly different clinical\noutcomes with OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors. These co-\nmutations may serve as biomarkers of clinical activity for OFF-\nstate KRASG12C inhibitors, should be integrated as stratiﬁcation\nfactors in clinical trials, and may guide escalated or de-escalated\ntreatment strategies. The key role of co-mutations in deﬁning\npatient subgroups with primary resistance and the diversity of\non-target mechanisms of resistance explaining early and acquired\nresistance to OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors suggest that\nKRASG12C-mutant lung adenocarcinomas are highly genetically\nheterogeneous. This intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity could\npartially explain the high proportion of early progressors and the\nlow proportion of durable responders. Pan-RAS/KRAS inhibitors\nmay prevent the emergence of acquired on-target mutations on\nKRAS and partly address the role of genetic heterogeneity in\nresistance to KRAS inhibition. For example, RMC-6236 is an\nON-state RAS multi-selective noncovalent inhibitor of the active,\nGTP-bound state of both mutant and wild-type variants of RAS\nisoforms (36). RMC-6236 exhibited potent anticancer activity\nacross RAS-addicted tumor models and showed early clinical\nactivity (36, 37).\nAmpliﬁcations or mutations of upstream RTK and upstream\nreactivation of GFR that drive RTK-driven pathway rebound can be\nprevented by RMC-6236 and ON/OFF-state direct inhibitors such\nas FMC-376 (38).\nUpstream and downstream dysregulation of the RAS signaling\npathway induced by OFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors offer attractive\ntargets for combination therapies. SOS1 and SHP2 are activated by\nRTK and regulate the switch of RAS from the OFF state to the ON\nstate. Inhibition of SOS1 and SHP2 activity stabilizes GDP-bound RAS\nin an inactive form (39–41). Several combinations including SOS1 and\nSHP2 inhibitors are under clinical evaluation (42).\nOther combinations under clinical evaluation include anti-PD-\n(L)1 with sotorasib or adagrasib (43). Sotorasib induced a\nproinﬂammatory tumor microenvironment highly sensitive to\nimmunotherapy in a preclinical study (44). The combination of\nsotorasib and anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in a higher response rate\nand more durable responses in mice compared to sotorasib\nmonotherapy or anti-PD-1 monotherapy (44). However, this\nstrategy with sotorasib is limited in clinical practice due to higher\nrates of side effects, mainly hepatotoxicity, when sotorasib is\nprescribed in combination with or following anti-PD(L)1 therapy\n(45, 46). Preliminary results from the KRYSTAL-7 phase II trial did\nnot show a higher rate of hepatotoxicity with adagrasib and\npembrolizumab, hinting at a possible non-class effect (47).\nMultiple ongoing studies are investigating OFF-state KRASG12C\ninhibitors and anti-PD(L)1 agents (43).\n5 Conclusion\nSeveral phase III trials comparing OFF-state KRASG12C\ninhibitors (sotorasib, adagrasib, divarasib, olomorasib, opnurasib)\nto standard-of-care chemotherapy and immunotherapy in NSCLC\nare ongoing (47–49). They will provide highly valuable data on the\nbeneﬁt of these drugs, the optimal sequencing strategy, and\nhopefully, insights into mechanisms of resistance to these drugs.\nChour et al.\n10.3389/fonc.2024.1328728\nFrontiers in Oncology\nfrontiersin.org\n06\nThe design of these trials mainly relies on patient selection\naccording to KRASG12C mutation and PD-L1 biomarkers.\nThe understanding of resistance mechanisms to KRASG12C\ninhibitors is in its early stages. It relies on data generated with\nOFF-state KRASG12C inhibitors, mainly sotorasib and adagrasib,\nbut provides an essential framework for future rationally designed\ntherapeutic development. Thus, the early emergence of RAS-MAPK\nsignaling reactivation through acquired resistance mutations and\nupstream reactivation of GFR underscores the strong need for RAS\nsignaling in KRASG12C-mutant cancers as well as the major role of\ntumor heterogeneity in resistance to OFF-state KRASG12C\ninhibitors. As a result, therapeutic strategies based on strong\ninhibition of RAS signaling (ON- or ON/OFF-state RAS\ninhibitors), broad inhibition of the RAS pathway (pan-RAS\ninhibitors), and combination strategies that target upstream or\ndownstream of the RAS pathway are relevant and currently being\nevaluated in clinical trials. There is a strong biological rationale\nsupporting KRASG12C inhibitors and immunotherapy, speciﬁcally\nanti-PD-(L1) agents, and combination strategies, and multiple\nclinical trials are evaluating the safety and clinical activity of such\ncombinations. Overall, the clinical evaluation of drug combination\nstrategies is the way to address the problem of primary and acquired\nresistance to KRASG12C inhibitors. These efforts should focus on\nunderstanding the biology driving KRASG12C-targeting clinical\nefﬁcacy and selecting the most effective and relevant combination\nstrategy and predictive biomarker of efﬁcacy for future development,\nespecially through phase III trials. Therapeutic platforms such as\nMaster Protocols can effectively evaluate multiple combination\nstrategies in KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC. ctDNA sample analysis\ncan be a highly valuable tool for identifying early signals of efﬁcacy\nand understanding mechanisms of resistance that may drive future\npreclinical and clinical development.\nAuthor contributions\nAC: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing – original draft,\nWriting – review & editing.

Greenblatt6,\nRoman Manetsch\n1,7 & Jeffrey N. Agar\n1,2,7\nCovalent drug discovery efforts are growing rapidly but have major unad-\ndressed limitations. These include high false positive rates during hit-to-lead\nidentiﬁcation; the inherent uncoupling of covalent drug concentration and\neffect [i.e., uncoupling of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics\n(PD)]; and a lack of bioanalytical and modeling methods for determining PK\nand PD parameters. We present a covalent drug discovery workﬂow that\naddresses these limitations. Our bioanalytical methods are based upon a mass\nspectrometry (MS) assay that can measure the percentage of drug-target\nprotein conjugation (% target engagement) in biological matrices. Further we\ndevelop an intact protein PK/PD model (iPK/PD) that outputs PK parameters\n(absorption and distribution) as well as PD parameters (mechanism of action,\nprotein metabolic half-lives, dose, regimen, effect) based on time-dependent\ntarget engagement data. Notably, the iPK/PD model is applicable to any\nmeasurement (e.g., bottom-up MS and other drug binding studies) that yields\n% of target engaged. A Decision Tree is presented to guide researchers through\nthe covalent drug development process. Our bioanalytical methods and the\nDecision Tree are applied to two approved drugs (ibrutinib and sotorasib); the\nmost common plasma off-target, human serum albumin; three protein targets\n(KRAS, BTK, SOD1), and to a promising SOD1-targeting ALS drug candidates.\nTraditionally, rational drug discovery focused on molecules that bind\nreversibly. This was due in part to the pharmaceutical industry’s\naversion to covalent (i.e., irreversible) interactions1,2, which tend to\nraise safety concerns due to off-target binding that can result in\nallergies and severe idiosyncratic drug reactions, e.g., from hapteni-\nzation and enzyme inhibition2. Nonetheless, meta-analyses show that\n30% of marketed drugs, including blockbusters such as aspirin, ome-\nprazole, and penicillin, employ covalent bonds2,3. Most of these were\ndiscovered using phenotypicassays (through serendipity) due to a lack\nof relevant methods for covalent inhibitors.\nThere\nis\ncurrently\na\nsurge\nin\nrational\ncovalent\ndrug\ndevelopment2,3.

This approach led to at least ten marketed\ndrugs3, e.g., ibrutinib targeting Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and\nafatinib targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Covalent\ndrug discovery recently adopted an electrophile-ﬁrst approach,\nwherein relatively selective electrophiles, discovered by chemopro-\nteomics, serve as a scaffold for further drug development. This\napproach is co-evolving with libraries of diverse electrophiles that\nexpand the number of potential targets, and whole-proteome che-\nmoproteomics technologies that identify—and assess the selectivity\nfor—new targets4–6. The electrophile-ﬁrst approach led to the discovery\nof SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor, nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid)7, and has been cred-\nited with making undruggable targets, such as KRAS, druggable\n(KRASG12C inhibitor, sotorasib [Lumakras])8,9.\nBioanalytical methods for traditional drugs (i.e., small molecule,\nnon-covalent) are well-established10 and are predicated upon a basic\ntenet of pharmacology that states drug concentration at the site of\naction is related to effect. Non-covalent drugs are in equilibrium with\ntheir targets. As a result, if the equilibrium binding constant (Ki) is\nknown and the free drug concentration is determined using a con-\nventional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/\nMS) assay, the percent inhibition can be extrapolated using the Cheng\nPrusoff equation11,12. The time dependence of analyte concentration in\nblood is used to derive traditional pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters\ne.g., area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax),\nvolume of distribution (Vd), clearance (CL), elimination half-life (t1/2),\nand to derive distribution and absorption coefﬁcients. PK, biochemical\n(Ki), and phenotypic parameters are then input into a PK/PD model to\npredict, for example, effect and dose regimen.\nFor all but the highest afﬁnity reversible ligands, PK ﬁndings\nconnect to PD through the direct relationship of concentration to\nenzyme modulation, but with covalent ligands this direct relationship\nis lost. Drugs that form covalent bonds to their protein targets are\npharmacologically unique because they bind irreversibly, which\nresults in non-equilibrium kinetics and the uncoupling of PK and PD13.\nTherefore, with covalent drugs the free drug concentration at the site\nof action is not indicative of the effect, which limits the predictive\npower of traditional bioanalysis with respect to pharmacodynamics2,3.\nMoreover, the low concentration of free covalent drugs can impede\nthe determination of an accurate AUC, and by extension absorption,\ndistribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters13. Addi-\ntional PK parameters are also required for covalent drugs because in\naddition to the clearance of the free drug, clearance of the drug-target\ncomplex and its relationship to protein synthesis (i.e., turn-over rate)\nmust be considered. In pioneering work to overcome these limitations,\nempirical relationships between PK and PD AUCs were established for\na number of drugs14 including aspirin15, pantoprazole16, penicillin17,18,\nand anticancer drugs19–21.\nClearly, covalent drug discovery would beneﬁt from bioanalytical\nmethods and PK/PD models that complement their traditional coun-\nterparts. Intact protein MS is increasingly used for quality control of\nbiotherapeutics22; in early covalent drug development23; and for\nquantitation, PK, biotransformation of biotherapeutics23,24. Intact\nprotein MS methods combined with immunoprecipitation have been\nused to determine drug to antibody ratio (DAR) for antibody drug\nconjugates25,26, in a mass range ( > 100 kDa) that includes common\ncovalent drug targets. Highly pertinent to the current study is the\napplication of intact mass (using puriﬁed protein) to the determination\nof kinact/KI, which can be used to interpret structure-activity relation-\nships (SARs) and measure selectivity. kinact/KI has been described as a\ncritical in vitro parameter27,28 for selecting covalent inhibitors and may\nsupplant IC50 (which is only appropriate for reversible inhibitors28) as\nthe standard for predicting the in vivo occupancy of covalent\ndrugs3,27,29–31. To our knowledge, intact protein MS has not been\napplied to in vivo PK/PD studies for covalent drug development.\nHere, we show, by taking advantage of the property that covalent\ndrugs and drug candidates (hereafter referred to as drugs for simpli-\ncity) remain conjugated to their targets, an intact protein MS assay that\ncan analyze the drug-target complex, and assess both drug mechanism\nof action (MoA) and % target engagement (%TE). This bioanalytical\nmethod is applicable from screening to in vivo studies, and therefore\nthroughout covalent drug development and clinical studies. We then\nderive a model to interpret time-dependent % TE data, which we term\n“intact protein PK/PD” (iPK/PD), that outputs both PK and PD para-\nmeters (absorption, distribution, and drug-target complex half-life,\nexposure, etc.). We present a workﬂow and create a results-based\nDecision Tree to guide researchers through drug candidate selection.\nWe apply these to leading preclinical familial ALS (fALS) drug candi-\ndates targeting SOD1 and approved drugs for popular targets KRAS\nand BTK.\nResults\nKinetic\nstabilization\nis\nemployed\nby\ntafamidis\nto\nstabilize\ntransthyretin32 and is a leading therapeutic strategy for stabilizing the\nquaternary structure of fALS-associated SOD1 variants33–37. Covalent\napproaches to kinetic stabilization of fALS SOD1 variants tend to target\na Cys residue (Cys111) within the SOD1 dimer interface, and have\nemployed cyclic disulﬁde derivatives38–40, disulﬁram41, cisplatin42 and\nebselen43. Our early screening efforts identiﬁed cyclic disulﬁde-based\nkinetic stabilizers using an infusion-ESI intact protein assay that could\nassess MoA44. Notably, this assay excluded 91 bond-forming com-\npounds (compared to 9 true positive hits) that would have been false-\npositive hits in conventional assays (e.g., size exclusion-based and 35S-\nlabeling). This illustrates the power of MS to improve covalent drug\nhigh-throughput screening efforts45. Our previous infusion-based MS\nassay, although capable of rapid sample analysis (<1 min/sample) is not\ncompatible with biological matrices. All the abbreviations used\nthroughout the manuscript are summarized in Supplementary Table 6.\nDevelopment of an LC-MS assay for determining target\nengagement within a biological matrix\nWe sought an intact protein liquid chromatography mass spectro-\nmetry (LC-MS) assay that is compatible with any phase of covalent\ndrug development. Based upon previous intact protein LC-MS meth-\nods standardization efforts46 an LC-MS assay was developed to\naccommodate a variety of soluble proteins (16 proteins with diverse\nfunctions and molecular weights, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplemen-\ntary Table 1). To accommodate the complexity of biological matrices,\nan enrichment step is highly recommended prior to LC-MS. For SOD1\nwe employed a fast (~10 min) chloroform/ethanol partitioning techni-\nque that is applicable to multiple biological matrices (e.g., whole\nblood, red blood cells [RBCs], and brain) and when coupled to LC-MS\nrequires less than a drop (20 µl) of blood for high S/N spectra. The\noutput of this bioanalytical assay, %TE, serves as the organizing prin-\nciple of this work. Moreover, accurate mass measurement provides an\nimportant quality control step on target protein preparations. Figure 1\nillustrates the detection and chromatographic separation for unmo-\ndiﬁed SOD1 (fALS SOD1G93A) and SOD1 modiﬁed by a covalent kinetic\nstabilizer (cross-linker 1,2-dithiane-1-oxide, hereafter “S-XL6” to denote\nSulfur mediated-crosslinking [XL] 6-membered cyclic thiosulﬁnate)\nand related sample preparation controls.\nAn MS-based decision tree for covalent drug development\nFor most covalent drugs, e.g., kinetic stabilizers or enzyme inhibitors,\n%TE is proportional to the on-target effect.

If a\ncompound does not succeed at this concentration, it is unlikely to be\ntherapeutically relevant. Treating ALS requires a CNS-permeable\ncompound, and so a mouse brain homogenate was chosen for the\npresent study. A “no-go” for D3 eliminated cisplatin from further\nconsideration as a fALS drug candidate because brain target engage-\nment is unlikely (Fig. 3). D4 requires titration of compound in the\nhomogenate of interest to extrapolate a minimally effective dose, and\nis “no-go” if the extrapolated dose is greater than the LD50 or above the\nestablished safety limit (Fig. 4). Considering the extrapolated doses\nwere all below the LD50s and the traditional preclinical screening\nresults were acceptable, ebselen, disulﬁram, and S-XL6 were a “go”\nfor D4.\nThe experiments proposed here for D1-D4 provide useful infor-\nmation for determining structure activity relationships, which may\nmerit their inclusion in high-medium throughput screening efforts. D4\nserves as a gatekeeper for humane animal studies and should therefore\nalso consider traditional preclinical screening methods and their\nrespective exclusion criteria44, as informed by therapeutic indication48,\nideally with input from a drug development specialist. For example,\npreclinical screening for SXL-6 included physicochemical properties\n(e.g., logD) and in vitro ADMET assays (e.g., plasma protein binding,\nhERG channel inhibited, cytotoxicity, CYP proﬁling, etc.,) as potential\n“no-gos.” We suggest that screening drug candidates for HSA binding,\nwhich serves as a proxy for plasma binding, be used as an additional\npreclinical assay (Fig. 6).\nDeﬁning the iPK/PD model\nTo our knowledge, previous PK/PD studies of covalent drugs were\nbased upon the empirical relationship of free drug concentration and\neffect. Here, we derive a model that accepts % target engagement as\ninput. Compounds that pass D4 are administered at an acceptable\ndose (e.g., estimated 50% TE or <½ of the LD50) and %TE is measured as\na function of time in the target tissue. Traditional PK/PD models link\nthe dose, time, and drug concentration (PK) to effect (PD) and are not\napplicable\nto\ncovalent\ndrugs.\nThat\nnotwithstanding,\ndrug\nconcentration-time curves and %TE-time curves are indistinguishable\nin their graphical form. It stood to reason that %TE-time curves could\nbe ﬁt using identical mathematical operations as drug concentration-\ntime curves, and thatby considering the different input (%TE instead of\ndrug concentration), the different outputs could be derived. The\nmathematical models used to treat traditional PK curves as well as\nmethods for extrapolating these results to effect (PK/PD modeling)\nhave been reviewed49–51. Based upon these studies, application of\nidentical mathematical operations to a traditional PK curve or an iPK/\nPD curve yields analogous parameters, including Tmax, AUC, and t1/2. In\neither case (traditional PK or iPK/PD) the ratio of AUCs of a particular\ntissue to the central compartment is the permeability coefﬁcient (Kp\nwith respect to the drug molecule, and Kp [TE] with respect to the\ntarget, respectively) and the ratio of AUCs of different routes of\nadministration (RoA) is the absorption coefﬁcient (%F with respect to\nthe drug molecule, and %F [TE] with respect to the target, respectively).\nWith traditional PK analysis t1/2 is that of drug itself and with iPK/PD it is\nthat of the drug-protein complex, which we note have no a priori\nrelationship. The detailed mathematical derivation as well as the cap-\nabilities and limitations of iPK/PD compared to existing models are\ndescribed in Supplementary Fig. 2. Notably, the %TE vs. time curve for\ndrug-protein complex is analogous to a traditional concentration-\ntime-effect (PK/PD curve) for small molecules. By analogy to well-\nestablished protein turnover measurements52, if the amount (e.g.,\nintensity) of the labeled target-time is ﬁt as shown in Fig. 4, the output\nwill be the protein degradation half-life. If the %TE-time is modeled, the\noutput will include protein synthesis, and yield the protein turnover\nnumber.\nTarget engagement of purified protein\nMETE target \nreached?\nMoA \ncorrect?\nMETE \nreached in tissue \nhomogenate of \ninterest?\nEstimated or\nre-estimated dose\n< LD50?\nMETE \nreached in vivo?\nSufficient \nexposure?\nAcceptable \nestimated or re-estimated\ndose regimen?\nTarget engagement in \ntissue homogenate\nTitration in tissue homogenate to \nextrapolate EC50 and estimate dose \nRe-estimate dose\nNo-go\nNo-go*\nNo-go\nNo-go\nDetermine %TEmax \nin vivo\niPK/PD to determine \n%TE, half-life, AUC\nMulti dose iPK/PD\nSuccess in vivo\nRe-estimate dose \nor dose interval\nNo-go*\nD2\nD3\nD4\nD5\nD6\nD7\nD1\nDecision #\nFig. 2 | An intact MS-based Decision Tree for covalent drug development.\nRectangles signify objectives and diamonds signify decisions.

First, iPK/PD has the disadvantage of being\nblind to any compound that is not conjugated to the target and\ntherefore does not address the absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nor elimination of the total compound. These must be addressed by\ntraditional PK studies. Second, compared to traditional PK/PD\nmodels, iPK/PD has the advantage of avoiding the assumptions used\nduring extrapolation between drug concentration and effect. Third,\nwhereas the half-life derived from traditional PK relates to the\nclearance of the compound itself, the half-life derived from iPK/PD\nrelates to the turnover of the protein target. Fourth, although the\nhalf-lives of traditional PK, iPK/PD, and protein turnover are all\nderived by ﬁtting curves where the numbers of Xe-kt terms49,52 equals\nthe number of compartments, PK compartments relate to different\ntissues, and iPK/PD and protein turnover compartments relate to\ndistinct pools of proteins.\nDisulﬁram\nCisplatin\nEbselen\nS-XL6\n15\n35\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.2\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.4\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.1\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15\n35\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.2\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.4\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.1\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15858.9\nProtein Treated\n15\n35\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8.\n16.2\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.6\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15.8\n16.1\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n Brain (in vitro)\n15\n35\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\nBrain (in vivo)\nProtein Untreated \nN\nS\nS S\nS\nN\nR-S\nN\nS\nS\nS\nS\nN\nSR\n+\nO\nN\nSe\nR-S\nB-H\nO\nHN\nSe\nRS\nR1\nH2\nC\nS\nNH2\nPt\nNH2\nCl\nCl\nPt\nNH2\nCl\nR1\nH2\nC\nS\nNH2\nR2\nH2\nC\nS\nCl\n-\nNH2\nPt\nH2N\nS\nR1\nC\nH2\nS\nC\nH2\nR2\nCl\n-\nS\nS\nO\nCys111\nS\nS\nS\nO\nCys111\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nOH\nH-B\nS\nS\nS\nS\nΔ Mass = 147.0 Da\nΔ Mass = 227.1 Da\nΔ Mass = 275.0 Da\nΔ Mass = 15977.0 Da\n+147 Da\n15858.9\n15858.9\n15858.9\n16310.9\n16005.9*\n16132.9\n15.8\n16.1\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n+452 Da\n+274 Da\n+15977 Da\n31835.9\n16006.8\n31835.7\n16133.4\n31835.8\n15.8\n16.2\nkDa\n600\n1000\n1800 m/z\n15858.8\n15858.9\n15858.9\n15858\n1585\n15\n15858\n15858\n15\n15858.\n5858\n58\nB-H\nExperiment not\nRequired\nGo!\nNo Go\nNo Go\nNo Go\nCys111\nCys111\nCys111\nCys111\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\nFig. 3 | Intact protein LC-MS analysis applied to covalent drug screening.\nCovalent drug candidates—disulﬁram (green, column 1), cisplatin (light blue, col-\numn 2), ebselen (purple, column 3), and S-XL6 (pink, column 4) were chosen for\nscreening as they target SOD1G93A, a fALS variant of SOD1 protein involved in ALS.\n(First row) The proposed mechanism of binding and the predicted mass shift for\neach covalent drug using intact protein LC-MS analysis.

The required dose, how-\never, will be subject to the combined effects of ADME. In particular,\nexposure will be affected by: absorption, which can be accounted for\nwith an IV dose; distribution, which can be estimated based upon\ncompound- and organ-related dependencies; and the disposition of\nthe compound via biotransformation and elimination, whose cumu-\nlative effects will be determined for compounds that proceed to D6\nand D7. With the objective of estimating the maximum value of %TE (%\nTEmax), animals are given the estimated dose, sacriﬁced at early time\npoints (e.g., 15 min, 30 min, 1 h), and the target tissues are harvested,\nprocessed, and %TEs are determined. If the METE is reached the\ncompound is “go” for D5; if not, the dose is re-estimated [New\ndose = (old dose) x (METE/ %TE old dose)] and %TE is reassessed as\ndescribed above. The METE could not be reached for ebselen (at ~22%\nof LD50) and disulﬁram (at a 20 mg/kg dose imposed by disulﬁram’s\nsolubility limit in our IV dose formulation [4 mg/mL]), eliminating\nthese compounds from further consideration (D5 “no-go”). Interest-\ningly, D5-related results indicated that ebselen, which improves\nsurvival in a SOD1G93A mouse model43, effected SOD1 in vivo by pro-\nmoting cysteinylation (in brain) and glutathionylation (in blood) of\nSOD1G93A, consistent with target engagement followed by compound\nremoval via thiol/selenosulﬁde exchange53. This ﬁnding illustrates that\nthe metabolic products of the target-drug conjugate can be discovered\nusing our methods. Exceptions to a D5 “no-go” can be made, for\nexample, in indications where the target product proﬁle (TPP) allows\nan alternative RoA that could increase exposure (e.g., intrathecal for\nneurodegeneration).\nIs the predicted dose regimen acceptable (D6)?\nThe remaining protocols depend upon multiple variables (e.g., ani-\nmal availability, drug accumulation, a Kp estimate that enables the\nanalysis of blood rather than target tissue etc.) and can be adjusted.\nAnimals are treated with a single dose and %TE-time is assessed in the\ntarget tissue at additional time points (e.g., with the dose and dura-\ntion informed by D5 results). Notably, an iPK/PD study will require a\nlonger duration than traditional PK studies (0-24 h) when the target-\ndrug conjugate’s half-life is greater than 1 day (as illustrated below for\nthe S-XL6-SOD1 complex). iPK/PD parameters are determined\nand from these parameters, in particular %TEmax and the one\nTime (hour)\nDimer (%)\nc.\n10 mg/kg IV (Blood)\n10 mg/kg IV (Brain)\n2 Compartmental iPK/PD \nModel\nd.\nTime (hour)\n0\n20\n10\n30\n10\n30\n50\n70\n0\n30\n10\n50\n70\nDimer (%)\n50\n70\n60\n40\n75\n0\n20\n60\n100\n140\n170\n150 mg/kg PO (Blood)\n%Dimermax (Cmax): 51%\nTmax: 8 hr\nAUC0-72: 2406\nBioavailability (%F): 8%\nAUC0-168: 3806\nKp (Brain): 1.01\nt1/2: 11 hours (fast compartment)\nt1/2: 87 hours (slow compartment)\nPO\nIV\nControl\n10 mg/kg \nI.V.

Guidance for minimizing animal usage is\nprovided in Supplementary.\nCan an acceptable dose regimen be achieved (D7)?\nThe design of optimal dose regimen has been described55 and depends\nhere upon factors that affect the dosing intervals, e.g., dose at %TEmax,\ndrug-target complex half-life, and METE. Using a time course and a\ndose frequency estimated from D6-related data, and at least two\ndoses, %TE-time is measured. After sufﬁcient administration this pro-\nvides a steady state exposure-time relationship, which based upon\nprior biological knowledge, can be extrapolated to an exposure-effect\nrelationship. If exposure is sufﬁcient following multiple doses, D7 is a\n“go”, i.e., the compound has potential as a therapeutic agent. It can\nthen progress to comparably more resource intensive studies includ-\ning standard (e.g., 14 day toxicology, etc.) and covalent drug-related\n(chemo- and toxicoproteomics to identify off-targets) safety assess-\nment, and the precise dose-ﬁnding needed for the development stage.\nThese experiments are currently in progress for S-XL6 in the SOD1G93A\nfALS mouse model.\nBroader application: considerations for screening different\ntherapeutic targets\nWe explored the applicability of the workﬂow above for the most\npopular covalent drug targets, KRAS (23 kDa), BTK (77 kDa) (Fig. 5),\nand EGFR (69 kDa) and the most prevalent off-target, HSA (Fig. 6).\nKRAS and BTK recombinant puriﬁed proteins were incubated with\ncovalent drugs sotorasib and ibrutinib respectively.

Additionally, for conﬁrming the\nsotorasib mechanism of action, we used in house puriﬁed GNP\n(active) and GDP (inactive) bound forms of KRAS. As expected,\nsotorasib fully bound GDP-KRAS and minimially bound GNP-KRAS,\neffectively locking the protein in the inactive state that inhibits\noncogenic\nsignaling56.\nThese\nresults\nwere\nconsistent\nwith\ncrystallographic56 (PDB: 6OIM) as well as previously reported\nbottom-up mass spectrometry studies57.\nThe next step in the workﬂow requires screening for ability to\nreach METE in target tissue preparations. KRAS presented an analytical\nchallenge at this step, because due to its instrinsically low abundance it\ncould not be detected by IP-MS in the 10 mg human tissue samples\navailable to us. The Kelleher group, however, showed that KRAS can be\ndetected in IP-MS studies from 200 mg tissue samples, allowing stu-\ndies with adequate tissue to progress through the entire iPK/PD\nworkﬂow. To facilitate intact protein detection from tissue homo-\ngenates, we spiked tissues with KRAS and proceeded as describe above\nfor SOD1 D3. Both immunoprecipitation (IP)-based and solvent\nextraction-based enrichment were successful in KRAS-spiked mouse\nlung homogenates and spiked patient lung samples (Supplementary\nFig. 3), which then progressed into the iPK/PD workﬂow at D3. As\nexpected, the above experiment conﬁrmed that METE was reached\nwith KRAS (D3 = Go). A summary of what is currently enabled for\nvarious targets, e.g., IP-MS and LC-MS methods, along with related\nreferences can be found in Supplemenatry Table 5. Brieﬂy, SOD1 and\nKRAS can proceed through the entire workﬂow, BTK can proceed\nthrough D2 (go for ibrutinib), and EGFR could not be detected by\nintact protein LC-MS. At present, BTK has been immunopuriﬁed by\nothers, and successful LC-MS studies have been performed by others,\nand a combined IP-MS method will need to be developed for steps\nbeyond D2. EGFR has been immunopuriﬁed by others, but to our\nknowledge there are no published intact protein studies.\nTo overcome limitations related to immunopuriﬁcation or intact\nprotein detection, we derived the formula to convert chemopro-\nteomics output, which has been successfully generated for BTK and\nEGFR, into %TE values (Supplementary Fig. 2) required for input into\nthe iPK/PD model. To enable studies on new targets, sensitivity\nbenchmarks and exemplar LOD, LOQ, and matrix effect calculations\nare provided for SOD1 in Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary\nTable 3, and Supplementary Table 4, respectively. Practically speaking,\n1 picomol of the targets examined here (Fig. 5) should be sufﬁcient for\nmicroﬂow (1-10 µL/min) LC-MS analysis. If additional sensitivity is\nrequired, more sample can be loaded or more sensitive nanoﬂow LC-\nMS analysis can be employed. For abundant the abundant target,\nSOD1, 1–10 mg of tissue is required, and for less abundant targets like\nKRAS, 200 mg of tissue is required58. For targets not considered here,\nthe relative sample loading required can be estimated from the above\nconsiderations or the previously described relationship of intact MS\nsensitivity and protein size59.\nIntact albumin screening reveals that more recent covalent\ndrugs exhibit decreased off-target plasma binding\nSerum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein (0.63 mM, con-\nstitutes ~60% total plasma protein) and a common off-target for\ncovalent drugs that directly inﬂuences PK/PD60. As such, covalent\ncompound binding to HSA can complement traditional preclinical\nplasma protein binding assays, by providing the MoA for HSA binding.\nThe LC-MS assay described above was applied to HSA and a variety of\ncovalent drugs (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the ﬁrst-generation covalent drug\n(from phenotypic assay and not-rationally designed), disulﬁram, con-\nverted 100% of HSA (at 20-fold molecular excess and equivalent to\n20 mg/kg dose) to an HSA-disulﬁram adduct by the mechanism shown\nin Fig. 3. This result is consistent with the previously described high\nplasma protein binding via albumin61. Second-generation covalent\ndrugs (rationally designed by appending an electrophile to a high-\nafﬁnity ligand) like afatinib and ibrutinib demonstrated limited, but\ndetectable covalent binding to HSA. The third-generation covalent\ndrug (electrophile-ﬁrst with core electrophile discovered by chemo-\nproteomics screening and rationally modiﬁed), soratosib, and fourth-\ngeneration electrophilic warhead (electrophile-ﬁrst with electrophile\nrationally designed to minimize lone-cysteine binding), S-XL6, resulted\nin no detectable HSA binding.\nDiscussion\nThis work demonstrated how an intact protein MS assay, interpreted\nusing our iPK/PD model, can advance covalent drug candidates\nthroughout preclinical drug development. Provided that the tissues\nare available, the same techniques are applicable to clinical trials and\npersonalized medicine. We tested the leading preclinical fALS SOD1\nkinetic stabilizers and identiﬁed one compound, S-XL6, that engaged\nand kinetically stabilized its target and exhibited BBB penetration\nand bioavailability with different RoAs. We demonstrated the\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56985-6\nNature Communications|   (2025) 16:1777 \n7\napplicability of our workﬂow to assess target engagement of\nimportant targets like KRAS and BTK. For targets where intact mass\nmeasurements or protein fractionation haven’t been developed, we\nprovide a means to port chemoproteomics data to the iPK/PD model.\nWe extended our on-target analysis methods to off-target analysis,\nand demonstrated that the extent of HSA binding, which is a primary\noff-target for most RoAs, can be estimated. From these studies a\nfascinating and reassuring trend emerged—covalent drugs are evol-\nving to exhibit less off-target binding to HSA. As we demonstrated\npreviously for SOD1, sufﬁcient enrichment62,63 can obviate the need\nfor LC and prepare samples that are compatible with emerging native\nMS techniques64–66. Notably, iPK/PD analysis is applicable to any\npreparation where %TE can be measured or inferred, including non-\ncovalent drugs analyzed by native MS techniques, endoproteinase\ndigests where the unmodiﬁed and drug-modiﬁed peptides are\ndetected67, and chemoproteomics methods that detect reactive\ncysteine abundance as a function of drug concentration. The iPK/PD\nmodel (i.e., % TE as input) applies to the target-bound drug, but does\nnot directly apply to free drug absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nand excretion. The methods proposed here are therefore com-\nplementary to traditional bioanalytical methods for free drug ana-\nlysis and chemoproteomics methods for off-target ID.\na\nb\nhKRASG12C (Commercial) + Sotorasib\nhKRASG12C (Commercial)\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n23\n24\n25 kDa\n23245.3\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n23\n24\n25 kDa\n23805.9\n+ 560.6 Da\nGo!\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) + Ibrutinib\nControl Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK)\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n77\n78\n79 kDa\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n77\n78\n79 kDa\nGDP-hKRAS4bG12C (in-house) + Sotorasib\nGDP-hKRAS4bG12C (in-house)\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n19\n20\n21 kDa\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n19\n20\n21 kDa\n+ 560.6 Da\n19753.5\n20314.1\nGo!\nGNP-hKRAS4bG12C (in-house) + Sotorasib\nGNP-hKRAS4bG12C (in-house)\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n19\n20\n21 kDa\n2000 m/z\n1000\n1500\nTotal Ion Current (a.u.)\n19\n20\n21 kDa\n+ 560.6 Da\n19753.5\n19753.5\n20314.1\n+ 438.6 Da\nGo!\n77862.9\n77424.3\nUnbound\nFig. 5 | Application of intact protein LC-MS to oncology targets.

Brain homogenates were prepared using a Potter-\nElvehjem homogenizer and 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.8 (2:1,\nammonium acetate to brain weight). 40 µL of both brain and blood\nwere dispensed to separate vials and labeled accordingly. The test\ncompounds for titration experiment were dispensed to both blood\nand brain vials according to the following ﬁnal concentrations: 0.1, 0.5,\n1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 µM ( < 2% DMSO). All samples\nwere then fractionated using ethanol and chloroform extraction as\npreviously described69.\nExpression and puriﬁcation of wild-type SOD1 and SOD1G93A\nExpression and puriﬁcation of SOD1 were conducted as previously\ndescribed44,62. Brieﬂy, EGy118ΔSOD1 yeast were transformed with a\nwild-type SOD1 and SOD1G93A YEp351 expression vector and grown at\n30 °C for 44-hr. Cultures were centrifuged, lysed in a blender using\n0.5 mm glass beads, and subjected to a 60% ammonium sulfate pre-\ncipitation. Then the sample was centrifuged, and the resulting super-\nnatant was diluted to 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. The diluted sample\nwas passed through a phenyl-sepharose 6 fast ﬂow (high sub) hydro-\nphobic interaction chromatography column (Cytiva Life Sciences,\nMarlborough, MA, USA) using a linearly decreasing salt gradient from\nhigh salt buffer (2.0 M ammonium sulfate, 50 mM potassium phos-\nphate dibasic, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT,\npH 7.0) to low salt buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate dibasic,\n150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT, pH 7.0) over\n300 mL. Fractions containing SOD1 eluted between 1.6 and 1.1 M\nammonium sulfate and were conﬁrmed with SDS-PAGE. These frac-\ntions were pooled and exchanged into low salt buffer (10 mM Tris pH\n8.0). Pooled fractions were then passed through a Mono Q 10/100\nanion exchange column (Cytiva Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA, USA)\nusing a linearly increasing salt gradient from low salt buffer to high salt\nbuffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 M sodium chloride) from 0 – 30%. SOD1\nfractions were collected between 5 and 12% high salt buffer and were\nconﬁrmed with SDS-PAGE, western blot, and Fourier Transform Ion\nCyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS).\nConﬁrmation of covalent drug-protein complex formation using\nLC-MS\nIn-house puriﬁed 40 µM wild-type SOD1 was diluted using 10 mM\nammonium acetate, pH 7.4 and combined with 400 µM (10x, 0.25% ﬁnal\nDMSO content) S-XL6 in equal volumes and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C\nand vortexed at 350 rpm. Cisplatin (1 mM) was incubated in hemizygous\nB6SJL mice expressing human SOD1G93A blood for 24-h at 37 °C. Com-\nplete cross-linking of cyclic thiosulﬁnates (S-XL6) and other reactions\n(e.g., drug-protein complex, post-IP (immunoprecipitation) samples,\ndisulﬁram, cisplatin, ebselen, afatinib, sotorasib and ibrutinib) were\nconﬁrmed by either an Agilent 6560 QToF mass spectrometer (Santa\nClara, CA) or by Bruker TIMS-ToF Flex mass spectrometer (Billerica,\nMA). Thiol alkylating agents – iodoacetamide (IAA, Fig. 1c, d) at 100 mM\nand N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Fig. 1e, f) at 10 mM were incubated for 1 h\nwith or without S-XL6 during method development. All in vitro assays\nwere performed in duplicates and repeated on differentMS instruments\nwith similar results. All the samples (total: 218 and control: 6) were\nanalyzed in duplicates by either an Agilent 1290 Inﬁnity II-series UHPLC\n(Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography) system coupled to\nan Agilent 6560 drift-tube ion mobility Q-ToF (quadrupole time of\nﬂight) mass spectrometer (IM-MS) (Santa Clara, CA) or a Bruker\nnanoElute2 (nanoLC) liquid chromatography system coupled to TIMS-\nToF (Trapped Ion Mobility quadrupole time of ﬂight) Flex as previously\ndescribed44,46,68,70,71. The n/LC system was equipped with reversed phase\nAcquity UPLC Protein BEH C4 (300 Å pore size, 1.7 µm particle size,\n100 mm bed length, 2.1 mm ID x 100 mm) column at 60 °C with a ﬂow\nrate of 0.3 mL/min or Acquity UPLC Protein BEH C4 (300 Å pore size,\n1.7 µm particle size, 100 mm bed length, 300 µm ID x 100 mm) column\nat 60 °C with a ﬂow rate of 3 µL/min. The mobile phase consisted of a\nmixture of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in\nacetonitrile (solvent B) and combined a gradient: 0-2 min: 95% A; 2-\n70 min: 30% A; 72-75 min: 5% A; 78-80 min: return to initial conditions.\nThe sample was introduced in 10% formic acid and 5 or 1 µL was injected\nfor analysis. The mass spectrometer was calibrated prior to all the\nsamples acquisition and the instrument was operated in positive ion\nmode. The source temperature was set to 150 °C and 200 °C, with\ndrying temperatures of 150 °C and 210 °C, drying gas ﬂow rates of 10 L/\nmin and 9 L/min, and nebulizer pressures of 30 psi and 26 psi for the\nAgilent 6560 QToF and Bruker TIMS-ToF Flex mass spectrometers,\nrespectively. Fragmentor voltages were maintained at 250 V and 300 V,\nwhile capillary voltages were set to 5000 V and 4500 V for each\ninstrument, respectively. Agilent MassHunter Workstation Data Acqui-\nsition software v9.0 (Santa Clara, CA) was used for controlling the\nAgilent LC-MS and BioConﬁrm v10.0 software was used for data pro-\ncessing. Similarly, timsControl software v5.1.8 (Billerica, MA) was used\nfor controlling the TIMS-ToF nanoLC-MS and Bruker Data Analysis\nv6.1 software was used for data processing.\nThe MS data were analyzed as previously described44. Brieﬂy, the\nchromatographic window containing the proteins of interest were\nassigned using EICs (Extracted Ion Chromatogram), e.g., m/z 1586.25-\n1587.25 (SOD1G93A monomer) and m/z 1516.50-1517.50 (SOD1G93A dimer)\nand mass spectra from this region were summed. The summed-up\nmass spectra from each region were deconvoluted and average masses\nwere calculated using the MaxEnt algorithm in either Agilent Bio-\nConﬁrm v10.0 or Bruker Data Analysis v6.1 software. The %TE was\ncalculated as the ratio of dimer intensity (31836 Da) to the monomer\n(15858 Da) plus dimer intensity. The ﬁt of the measured dimer values\nwas performed and calculated by incorporating 2-compartment model\nequation using GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.2, San Diego, California).\nIn vivo dosing and tissue sample preparation for mass spectro-\nmetry analysis\nAll methods and animal manipulations conformed to the guidelines\nand were approved by the Northeastern University InstitutionalAnimal\nCare and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol #16-0303-R.

Animals in the age range of 15–30 weeks were used\nfor in vivo testing; sex was not considered in this study. Animals were\nacclimatized with a 12 h dark/light cycle (24°C, 30% humidity). Test\narticles were prepared either in 1x PBS or water (depending upon the\nsolubility, <2% ﬁnal DMSO content) and mice/rat were dosed slowly at\na speciﬁed dose level (mg/kg) via a suitable route of administration\n(intravenous, subcutaneous, or oral). Mice were kept in a restrainer or\nsacriﬁced to collect blood and brain at different time points (1, 4, 8, 24,\n48, 72, and 168 h) for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assay or at a\nsingle time point tissue collection. Protein extraction was performed\nas previously described69. Brieﬂy, homogenates were treated with an 8\nequivalents of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.4), followed by 0.15\nequivalents of cold chloroform and 0.25 equivalents of cold ethanol,\nand vortexed at 1800 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at\n17,700 g for 10 min.

Protease inhibitor (SIGMAFAST protease\ninhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the sample homogenization\nprocedure to avoid any proteolysis.\nImmunoprecipitation Mass Spectrometry (IP-MS) sample\npreparation\nThe immunoprecipitation method optimization was done using Dyna-\nbeads Protein G IP kit (Invitrogen) and mouse lung tissue. KRAS protein\nwas enriched using human KRAS protein-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody\n(Thermo Scientiﬁc). 50 µL (1.5 mg) of magnetic beads were used at\n30 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.01% Tween-20 and 0.09% sodium azide\n(preservative), for each IP experiment. The anti-KRAS antibody (10 µg)\nwas diluted in 200 µL antibody binding and washing buffer before\nadding it to the prepared magnetic beads. After washing step,\n250–500 µL tissue homogenate samples (containing KRAS protein)\nwere added to the antigen binding step to form the immune complex.\nKRAS protein was eluted using 0.2% TFA, which enabled subsequent\ndownstream intact protein MS analysis. Due to inherently low abun-\ndance of KRAS protein in the tissues of interest, the eluted protein was\nconcentrated using SpeedVac (Thermo Scientiﬁc), followed by recon-\nstitution in 100% water. With the optimized IP procedure, KRAS protein\nwas detected with the intact protein LC-MS method described above.\nThe experiments were repeated three times with similar results.\nReproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, matrix effect, and preci-\nsion experiments\nBlood was collected from control B6SJL hemizygous mouse for the\ncalibration curve experiments to perform reproducibility and sensi-\ntivity measurements. 40 µL of blood was dispensed in separate tubes.\nFor monomer standard curve, human SOD1 was added to blood vials\naccording to the following ﬁnal concentrations: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1,\n2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 µM. For the dimer standard curve, hSOD1 was\ndispensed to blood vials containing 5 mM S-XL6 previously spiked into\nthe preparation to form a dimer. All vials were incubated at 37 °C for\n3 h. All samples were then fractionated using ethanol and chloroform\nextraction as described69. The internal standard 13C, 14N-labeled ubi-\nquitin, purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs (Tewksbury, MA), was\nspiked into both monomer and dimer standard curves. Quality control\nsamples i.e., 1, 5 and 15 µM for monomer and 2.5, 5 and 20 µM for dimer,\nwere prepared separately for each calibration run (Supplementary\ntable 2 and 3). Additionally, matrix effect quality control samples i.e., 1,\n5 and 10 µM for monomer and dimer were prepared separately and %\nmatrix effect was calculated based on mean peak area ratio of mean\npeak area of the analytes spiked post-extraction to the mean-peak area\nof the same analyte standards (Supplementary table 4). Statistical\nanalysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.2, San\nDiego, California). Data from three independent measurements were\nanalyzed to calculate precision, accuracy and matrix effect.\nDerivation and detailed description of the iPK/PD model\nAnalysis of the target tissue is required due to violation of the free drug\nhypothesis by covalent drugs, which results in drug concentration\nasymmetry. Notably, drug concentration asymmetry is pervasive,\nincluding for reversible binders, and difﬁcult to model for the CNS, the\nfocus of this study.\nAssumptions in the iPK/PD model\n• The ionization efﬁciency of the protein with and without the drug\nremains unchanged. Note, this only applies to the measurement\nof %TE, and is not an assumption (i.e., is factored out) when ratios\nof %TE are taken [i.e., Kp(TE) and F(TE)].\n• When extrapolating in vitro (target tissue homogenates) results to\nin vivo, there are certain underlying assumptions such as –\n• If k is unknown, there is no barrier between target and site of\nmeasurement.\n• Equal partitioning among the organs.\n• The off-target binding is the same across the organism.\n• Rate of distribution is signiﬁcantly higher than the rate of\nmetabolism of both the small molecule and the complex.\n• There is a lackof feedback drug-related up or down regulation of\nthe target (e.g., from downstream signaling, activate proteases),\nand no target manipulation (tolerance).\n• The tissue homogenate extrapolation to whole organ follows the\nsame rules and recommendations as suggested by health\nauthorities73. Target expression studies can be conducted while\nvalidating a target for a disease indication. The complexity and\ndependencies of target expressed within tissue/cell types will\nthen be extrapolated from these studies to consider target tissue\nfor analysis.\nDrug-target complex half-lives are obtained by ﬁtting the curve\nwith one or more of the generalized terms Cie-kit (C=Normalization\nConstants), e.g., TE = TE0 e−kTE*t and TE(t) = Ce-γt + De-δt for one and two\ncompartment models, respectively, by analogy to traditional PK\nmethods.\nCorollaries of the iPK/PD model\n• The k[TE] is the turnover constant for the drug-protein complex\nand the half-life obtained is the drug-protein complex degrada-\ntion half-life (turnover of the target).\n• %F(TE) is the absorption coefﬁcient with respect to (only) the drug-\nprotein complex. When target is present in blood, absolute %F (TE)\ncan be calculated as ratio of area under the curves (AUCs) for a\nspeciﬁc route of administration compared to intravenous route.\nWhen target is not present in blood, a relative %F(TE) can be\nobtained by comparing AUCs in target tissue for two different\nroutes of administration.\n• Kp, (TE) is the tissue partition coefﬁcient with respect to the drug-\nprotein complex. It can be calculated as the ratio of %TE(tissue) to %\nTE(blood), only when the target is present in the blood.\n• The compartments in traditional PK refer to different tissues\nwhereas, in protein metabolism refer to different pools of pro-\nteins within a cell.\nTraditional PK/PD model assumptions that do not apply to\niPK/PD\n• Drug concentration (free/unbound) is the driving force of the\npharmacological effect.\n• Unbound drug concentration in blood is same as that at the site of\naction (at steady state).\n• Drug and target are in equilibrium.\n• Drug (speciﬁcally the Drug-Target complex) is eliminated from\nthe body through the central compartment (metabolism in liver\nand or excretion via kidney).\nRelating the iPK/PD model to traditional PK, PK/PD, and protein\nmetabolism models\nThe mathematical derivation of iPK/PD model is shown and is related\nto traditional PK, PK/PD, and protein metabolism models in Supple-\nmentary Fig. 2.\nConsideration of target turnover in iPK/PD\nIn iPK/PD model presented, the overall covalent drug PK and PD out-\ncomes depend upon the %TE measurements of the drug-target protein\ncomplex. %TE inform the drug-target binding process, that includes\nArticle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56985-6\nNature Communications|   (2025) 16:1777 \n11\ntarget turnover rate. Target half-life and de novo synthesis of target\ninﬂuences the duration of PD response. A potential approach is using %\nTE from intact covalent-drug protein complex measurements that\noutputs the half-life of the complex (i.e., target), enabling a direct\ncorrelation of PK to PD, which otherwise is not possible with traditional\nPK74,75.\nAvoiding terminal experiments through the analysis of proxy\ntissues (D6 and D7)\nUnfortunately, the analysis of the target tissue often requires a term-\ninal experiment (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases and brain neo-\nplasms). In these cases, certain terminal experiments can be avoided if\nthe target is also present in an accessible tissue (ideally blood), so long\nas a target-speciﬁc Kp(TE) is determined (%TEtarget tissue/ %TEblood). This\nallows extrapolation of exposure in the target tissue through the fol-\nlowing equation [%TEtarget tissue = %TEblood * Kp(TE)]. Likewise, if an\nalternative RoA (to IV) is to be considered and the target is present in\nblood, the ratio of the AUCs (%TE vs. time) in blood for oral vs. IV\nadministration provides an absolute F(TE) (F with respect only to Target\nEngagement, for derivation, see Supplementary Fig. 2). The oral LD50\nmay then be determined to assure the predicted dose is within the\nsafety margin. If the target is not present in an accessible tissue, a\nrelative F(TE) can only be determined as the ratio of AUCs in the target\ntissue for two different routes of administration, as described in the\nmain text.\nReproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and matrix\neffect results\nThe linearity of the intact protein LC-MS assay was established over the\nconcentration range of 0.5 µM – 25 µM for hSOD1 monomer, and with\nsimilar concentration range of hSOD1 incubated with a ﬁxed amount of\nS-XL6 (dimer concentrations), spiked into mouse whole blood. The\nselected concentration range covers the therapeutically relevant\nconcentrations for SOD1 in healthy and disease-state (fALS) patients.\nThe internal standard used in the quantitation was 13C, 15N-labeled\nubiquitin eluting at 22.6 min in the LC-MS method76. Regression ana-\nlysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (10.1.2) and cor-\nrelations of R2 ~ 0.93 (monomer) and R2 ~ 0.95 (dimer) were obtained.\nThe lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.5 µM for both monomer\nand dimer curves was obtained using peak area ratios. The selectivity\nof the LC-MS method was established with the detection of intact SOD1\nmonomer peak at 24.2 min and S-XL6-mediated SOD1 dimer peak at\n25.5 min in total ion chromatograms, without interferring with any\nendogenous components (Fig. 1). The data for accuracy (% bias), pre-\ncision, and matrix effect for the intact protein LC-MS assay are sum-\nmarized in Supplementary Table 2 (monomer), Supplementary Table 3\n(dimer), and Supplementary Table 4, respectively. The intra-run bias\nwas between -5.97 – 1.63% for monomer and -3.25 – 19.2% for dimer,\nwith intra-run precision values ranged from 1.9 – 8.4 % and 0.6 – 0.9%\nfor monomer and dimer, correspondingly.\nConsideration of semi-physiological PK parameters\nWe derived the iPK/PD model from the anachronistic (simplest) PK/PD\nmodel. In the anachronistic model the number of compartments is\nequal to the number of exponential terms. When distribution or\nelimination occurs in multiple compartments (e.g., tissues), this can be\nexpanded for a given drug and target to more customized physiolo-\ngically or semi-physiologically based PK models77,78. For example, a\nsimplistic semi-physiological PK model would include blood com-\npartment, assumes similar perfusion across all compartments to\nreduce model complexity, and produces a quick snapshot of the\ncovalent drug’s fate in vivo. A more complex semi-physiological PK\nmodel would include different rate constants for different tissues.\nJones H. M. et al., reviews the use of multi-tissue compartments as\neither perfusion (rate of blood ﬂow) or permeability (drug-speciﬁc)-\nlimiting kinetics77. When the iPK/PD requires more than two terms for a\nﬁt, it is important to recognize (see Supplementary section derivation\nof the iPK/PD) that the terms likely involve protein degradation con-\nstant, i.e., they are compartments in the sense of protein metabolism/\ncatabolism; not compartments in the physiological sense (e.g., organ).\nThe derivation and meaning of such terms of different organ com-\npartments can be found in the work of Burlingame52. In the three term\nmodels of Burlingame’s work, one compartment is the free amino acid\npool, the second is the total protein pool, and the third is protein of\ninterest pool.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature\nPortfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\nData availability\nThe mass spectrometry data generated in this study have been\ndeposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE data-\nbase under accession code PXD046903.

In 2024, it is estimated that the\nUnited States will record 234,580 new lung cancer cases and 125,070\ndeaths, highlighting a substantial public health challenge (1). Non-\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of lung\ncancer cases (2). Extensive research has identiﬁed several common\ndriver mutations in NSCLC, including ampliﬁcations of the epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)\nfusions, mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n(KRAS), BRAF V600E mutations, and ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor\ntyrosine kinase (ROS1) fusions. Although KRAS mutations are\nless prevalent than EGFR alterations, they are present in 25-30% of\nNSCLC cases (3). The prevalence of KRAS mutations in NSCLC\nvaries based on factors such as geographic location and smoking\nhistory. For instance, the mutation rate in U.S. lung adenocarcinoma\npatients is signiﬁcantly higher than in Asian patients (approximately\n35% vs. 13%) (4). Smoking status is also a key determinant, with KRAS\nmutations being most common among former or heavy smokers (4, 5).\nRegarding gender, while some studies suggest a slightly higher\noverall mutation rate in women, the gender distribution in speciﬁc\nsubtypes such as KRAS G12C appears to vary across racial\ngroups, warranting further conﬁrmation (6, 7). The RAS family\nfunctions as signal transducers, with conserved N-terminal and\nhighly variable C-terminal domains. As a key member of this family,\nKRAS is integral to signal transduction pathways (8). KRAS mutations\nin cancer predominantly occur in codons 12, 13, or 61 (9). In NSCLC,\nmutations in the glycine residue at codon 12 (G12) represent over 80%\nof KRAS mutations, followed by mutations at G13 and Q61. The KRAS\nG12C mutation is the most prevalent, accounting for approximately\n39% of all KRAS mutations in NSCLC (10, 11).\nKRAS has long been considered an undruggable target (12), and\nmost patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC currently receive\nconventional platinum-based chemotherapy, which is associated with\npoor prognosis. In recent years, signiﬁcant progress has been made in\ndeveloping inhibitors targeting KRAS G12C, with AMG 510\n(sotorasib) and MRTX849 (adagrasib) advancing most rapidly.\nThese two inhibitors were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) on May 18, 2021, and December 13, 2022,\nrespectively. However, AMG 510 faced challenges in phase III trials.\nThe CodeBreaK 200 trial (NCT04303780) demonstrated that the\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months for\n169 patients treated with AMG 510, compared to 4.5 months for\n174 patients treated with docetaxel; despite this, there was\nno signiﬁcant difference in median overall survival (OS) between\nthe groups, drawing some criticism from the FDA (13). New KRAS\nG12C inhibitors such as D-1553 (Garsorasib), IBI351 (Fulzerasib),\nand JAB-21822 (Glecirasib) have shown promising results in clinical\ntrials, with further research ongoing (14–16). The efﬁcacy of KRAS\nG12C inhibitors has encountered limitations, with challenges related\nto drug resistance persisting (17). To address resistance, various\ncombination therapies with KRAS G12C inhibitors are being\ntested, including combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors,\nchemotherapeutic agents, MEK inhibitors, and SHP2 inhibitors.\nProgrammed death receptor 1 (PD-1), a member of the\nimmunoglobulin superfamily ﬁrst identiﬁed by Honjo’s team in\n1992, is primarily expressed on the surface of activated T cells (18).\nWhen PD-1 binds to its ligand, PD-L1, it drives immune evasion by\nsuppressing T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, reducing the secretion\nof cytotoxic molecules such as IFN-g, and inducing T-cell\nexhaustion (19, 20). PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as\nPembrolizumab and Nivolumab, restore T-cell activity by\nblocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, thereby reactivating the\nanti-tumor functions of T cells. These agents have become\ncornerstone therapies for solid tumors, including NSCLC (19, 20).\nGiven the signiﬁcant immunomodulatory properties of KRAS\nG12C inhibitors, which can reshape the immune system and\nbolster anti-tumor responses, anti-PD-(L)1 therapies may achieve\na synergistic effect when combined with KRAS G12C inhibitors.\nCurrently, multiple KRAS G12C inhibitors are exploring\ncombination use with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies to address the many\nchallenges these drugs face (21, 22). By summarizing existing\nliterature, conference reports, and clinical trial data, our study\ndiscusses the epidemiology of KRAS G12C Mutant NSCLC, the\noncogenic mechanisms of KRAS mutations, and their immune\nimpact. This study focuses on the efﬁcacy and safety of KRAS\nG12C inhibitors both as monotherapies and in combination\ntherapies, including anti-PD-(L)1 treatments, incorporating the\nlatest clinical research ﬁndings to provide new insights and\nperspectives for clinical and research professionals.\n2 Epidemiology of and biology of\nKRAS G12C in NSCLC\nStatistics indicate that KRAS mutations in cancer\npredominantly occur at codons 12, 13, or 61 (9). In NSCLC,\nmutations at codon 12 account for over 80%, followed by\nmutations at codons 13 and 61. Among these, the codon 12\nmutations include KRAS G12C, G12D, and G12V, with KRAS\nG12C being the most common. It represents approximately 39% of\nall KRAS mutations in NSCLC (10, 11). Additionally, KRAS G12C\nin NSCLC is more frequently observed in Caucasian and African\nAmerican patients compared to Asian patients. Notably, in\nCaucasian populations, the frequency of KRAS G12C is higher in\nfemales than in males, while the reverse is true among Asian\npatients (6). Furthermore, KRAS G12C is typically more\nprevalent in patients with a history of smoking (23).\nThe rat sarcoma virus oncogene (RAS) family functions as a\nconserved GTPase signal transducer, with a conserved N-terminal\ndomain and a highly variable C-terminal domain, playing a crucial\nrole in signal transduction (8). The oncogene KRAS, which is\npathogenic in various cancers, is a member of the RAS gene\nfamily. There are two types of KRAS genes, KRAS1 and KRAS2,\nlocated on the short arm of chromosome 6 and chromosome 12,\nrespectively. The KRAS protein, with 188 amino acids and a\nmolecular weight of 21.6 kDa, comprises a catalytic domain\nknown as the G-domain and a hypervariable region (HVR). The\nG-domain includes a phosphate (P) loop, along with two switches,\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nSwitch I and Switch II, while the HVR contains the CAAX motif\nrelated to membrane localization (24, 25). KRAS acts as a\n“molecular switch” in signal transduction due to its GTPase\nactivity, toggling between an inactive state when bound to GDP\nand an active state when bound to GTP. This activity regulates\nsignal transduction from activated membrane receptors to\nintracellular molecules. Upon stimulation by extracellular signals\nsuch as growth factors (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor,\ninsulin-like growth factors), hormones, cytokines, and\nneurotransmitters, upstream molecules are activated. GTPase-\nactivating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange\nfactors (GEFs) regulate this process by mediating the conversion\nbetween KRAS-GTP and KRAS-GDP states, thereby activating\ndownstream effectors and signal transduction pathways associated\nwith cell proliferation and survival (Figure 1) (25, 26). Conversely,\nwhen KRAS is mutated, GAPs cannot effectively enhance the\nGTPase catalytic rate, reducing its ability to hydrolyze GTP. This\nmutation keeps KRAS in an active GTP-bound state, leading to\ncontinuous activation of downstream signaling pathways, as KRAS\nmaintains a high afﬁnity for GTP. Furthermore, the structural\nfeature of wild-type KRAS, lacking a sufﬁciently large surface\npocket, prevents potential small molecule inhibitors from binding,\nhistorically rendering KRAS undruggable (27). However, KRAS\nG12C, where the 12th amino acid glycine is replaced by cysteine,\nrepresents a breakthrough (Figure 1). Unlike other mutations,\nKRAS G12C, located on the P-loop, exhibits GTPase activity\nsimilar to wild-type KRAS (28). Nevertheless, KRAS G12C leads\nto sustained downstream activation due to its stabilized nucleotide\nstate, which reduces the nucleotide cycling rate and promotes\ncontinuous cell proliferation rather than affecting the GDP-GTP\nexchange rate (29). This characteristic positions KRAS G12C\nresearch as a breakthrough in targeting the historically\nchallenging KRAS target. Eventually, a team discovered a small\nmolecule capable of irreversibly binding to KRAS G12C by targeting\nthe cysteine formed due to the mutation. This small molecule\ncreates a new pocket beneath the Switch II region, keeping KRAS\nin a GDP-bound state, which impedes its effective binding with\ndownstream effectors like RAF (Figure 1) (30). This research has\nushered in a new era in targeting KRAS.\n3 Advancements and clinical impact of\nKRAS G12C inhibitors\nSubsequently, extensive research has continually enhanced\nthe inhibitory effects on KRAS G12C, leading to the development\nof a series of KRAS G12C inhibitors such as ARS-853, ARS-1620,\nAMG 510, and MRTX859, among others. ARS-853 and ARS-1620,\nFIGURE 1\nLeft Panel, The intracellular signaling pathways of KRAS G12C. Upper Right Panel, Mechanism of KRAS G12C mutation. Lower Right Panel, The\ninterconversion between KRAS-GTP and KRAS-GDP bound states and mechanism of action for representative inhibitors of KRAS G12C.\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n03\namong the ﬁrst KRAS G12C inhibitors developed, have not yet\nentered clinical trials. Most KRAS G12C inhibitors have begun\nclinical trials, with two main drugs taking center stage: AMG 510\n(31) and MRTX849 (32). Additionally, clinical trials for several\nnovel KRAS G12C inhibitors have yielded varying degrees of\nresults. The efﬁcacy and safety data from these trials are\nsummarized in Table 1. Furthermore, various KRAS G12C\ninhibitors are being tested in combination with non-traditional\ntherapies, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, with the\nspeciﬁc combination regimens detailed in Table 2.\n3.1 Early-stage investigational drugs\nThe development of KRAS G12C inhibitors began with\npreclinical studies. ARS-853 was the ﬁrst inhibitor identiﬁed to\nselectively inhibit intracellular KRAS, with studies demonstrating\nits low micromolar potency in cells and its ability to efﬁciently target\nKRAS G12C bound to GDP (Figure 2) (33). However, subsequent\nresearch revealed that ARS-853 is inactive in vivo, and it is currently\nused only as a tool compound. ARS-1620, a newly developed KRAS\nG12C inhibitor, shares the same mechanism of action as ARS-853\nbut exhibits better bioavailability (Figure 2). Unlike ARS-853, ARS-\n1620 speciﬁcally targets the KRAS G12C mutation both in vivo and\nex vivo (34). However, ARS-1620 has not advanced to clinical trials.\nAlthough ARS-1620 was reported to inhibit KRAS G12C and block\nKRAS-GTP formation ex vivo, residual KRAS activity was observed\nin live cells (35). Some studies have found that ARS-1620 effectively\ninhibits tumor growth both in vivo and ex vivo when used in\ncombination with mTOR, IGF1R, and SHP2 inhibitors (36, 37).\nPlans for these combination regimens were put on hold due to the\nlimitations of ARS-1620, which never progressed to clinical trials.\nDespite these preclinical inhibitors not fully addressing the clinical\nchallenges, they provided valuable insights and evidence for the\ndevelopment of future drugs.\n3.2 Frontline drugs\n3.2.1 AMG 510 (Sotorasib)\nAMG 510, developed by Amgen, is the ﬁrst FDA-approved\ninhibitor of KRAS G12C. It shares a similar ligand structure with\nARS-1620, speciﬁcally binding to the Switch II pocket of KRAS\nG12C that binds GDP, using the acrylamide portion for slow\nbinding to cysteine-12 (38). Compared to ARS-1620, AMG 510\nhas a highly optimized methylisopropylpyridine substituent,\nenhancing its interaction by binding to the His95 groove of KRAS\nG12C (Figure 2). This optimization results in approximately 10\ntimes higher potency than ARS-1620 (31). AMG 510 selectively\ninhibits KRAS G12C mutants while showing insensitivity to other\nsubtypes or wild-type KRAS (31, 39). Additionally, AMG 510\nexhibits reasonable oral bioavailability across species (38).\nEncouraged by these preclinical results, AMG 510 advanced to\nclinical trials. In the CodeBreak100 (NCT03600883) Phase I/II trial,\nAMG 510 demonstrated favorable efﬁcacy and safety (40, 41),\nleading to its FDA approval on May 28, 2021, as the ﬁrst direct\ninhibitor of KRAS G12C. A long-term analysis of the trial updated\nwith the latest data included 174 previously treated patients\nreceiving AMG 510 at a dose of 960 mg QD. Results showed an\nobjective response rate (ORR) of 41%, a disease control rate (DCR)\nof 84%, a median PFS of 6.3 months, an OS of 12.5 months, a\nmedian duration of response (DOR) of 12.3 months, a 1-year OS of\n51%, and a 2-year OS of 33%, all signiﬁcantly higher than previous\nresults with pemetrexed and docetaxel (42, 43). However, 70% of\npatients experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs),\nwith 21% being grade 3 or higher. The most common TRAEs\nwere diarrhea (30%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels (18%), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels\n(18%) (43). The results of the Phase III AMG 510 vs. docetaxel trial\nwere less encouraging. The CodeBreaK 200 (NCT04303780), a\nrandomized, controlled Phase III trial, compared AMG 510’s\nefﬁcacy and safety to docetaxel in previously treated patients with\nadvanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. Median PFS for the AMG\n510 group improved to 5.6 months over the 4.5 months of the\ndocetaxel group, but OS did not improve (13). Despite better quality\nof life and reduced toxicity, survival outcomes were\nunderwhelming, leading to a critical analysis by the FDA’s\nOncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, casting uncertainty on\nAMG 510’s clinical value and necessitating further evidence for\ncontinued market presence.\nAMG 510 is being explored in various combination therapies,\ndemonstrating promising efﬁcacy and manageable safety. In the\nCodeBreaK 101 trial, AMG 510 combined with platinum-doublet\nchemotherapy showed notable results in NSCLC patients, with a\n65% ORR, a median PFS of 10.8 months in ﬁrst-line therapy, and a\n42% ORR in second-line and beyond treatment (44). Combinations\nwith other agents are also under investigation, including MEK\ninhibitors (trametinib) and pan-ErbB inhibitors (afatinib),\nachieving ORRs of 20%-34.8% and DCRs up to 87% (45, 46).\nOngoing trials are evaluating AMG 510 with Raf/MEK and SHP2\ninhibitors, aiming to expand its therapeutic potential (47).\n3.2.1 MRTX849 (Adagrasib)\nMRTX849 is another well-studied irreversible inhibitor with a\nmechanism of action similar to that of AMG 510 (Figure 2) (32, 48).\nIt has been shown that MRTX849 exhibits higher activity among a\nwide range of FDA-approved covalent drugs and offers greater\nstability compared to AMG 510 (49). Clinical results from the\nKRYSTAL-1 Phase I/II study, which evaluates the efﬁcacy and\nsafety of MRTX849, demonstrated favorable outcomes (50). Two-\nyear follow-up data from the KRYSTAL-1 study reinforce\nMRTX849’s role in previously treated patients with KRAS G12C-\nmutated NSCLC. As of January 1, 2023, 132 patients treated with\nMRTX849 had a median OS of 14.1 months and a median PFS of\n6.9 months. About one-third of patients achieved durable two-year\nefﬁcacy, with a safety proﬁle consistent with previous reports, and\nno new safety signals identiﬁed (51).

The KRYSTAL-12 Phase III study (NCT04685135) is\ncurrently recruiting patients to compare the efﬁcacy of MRTX849\n(600 mg BID) with docetaxel (52). This study aims to determine if\nMRTX849 yields different results from AMG 510, potentially\nadvancing the development of KRAS G12C inhibitors. Notably,\nMRTX849 has demonstrated the ability to combat brain metastases,\nwhich may not be the case with AMG 510. NSCLC patients with\nKRAS G12C are more prone to developing brain metastases (53).\nPreclinical brain metastasis modeling studies have shown that\nMRTX849 achieves high cerebrospinal ﬂuid concentrations, with\nan unbound brain to unbound plasma concentration ratio of 1 at a\n200 mg/kg dose level after 8 hours, indicating strong blood-brain\nbarrier penetration (53). This study highlights MRTX849’s\ntherapeutic potential in the central nervous system and its\nimplications for developing additional KRAS G12C inhibitors\ntargeting brain metastases. The KRYSTAL-1 trial also included\ncohorts evaluating MRTX849 in patients with CNS metastases from\nNSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations. Imaging indicated an ORR of\n42%, a DCR of 90%, a median PFS of 5.4 months, and a median OS\nof 11.4 months among MRTX849-treated patients. The treatment\nregimen was consistent with other cohorts, with CNS-speciﬁc\nTRAEs including dysgeusia (24%) and dizziness (20%) (54).\nMRTX849 is the ﬁrst KRAS G12C inhibitor prospectively\ndemonstrated to have intracranial activity, offering efﬁcacy\nagainst brain metastases. This positions MRTX849 to potentially\nsurpass AMG 510 and become the ﬁrst KRAS G12C inhibitor\nmarketed in multiple regions.\nOngoing studies are enhancing MRTX849’s antitumor activity\nthrough combination therapies. In KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal\ncancer, combining MRTX849 with the anti-EGFR antibody\ncetuximab achieved an ORR of 34%, a DCR of 85%, and a\nmedian PFS of 6.9 months, with favorable outcomes and a\ntolerable safety proﬁle (55). This regimen has been FDA approved\nfor advanced colorectal cancer patients with KRAS G12C\nmutations. Other combinations, including SOS1 inhibitors,\nmTOR inhibitors, and SHP2 inhibitors, are under investigation to\nfurther expand its clinical potential (56).\n3.3 Novel drugs\n3.3.1 D-1553 (Garsorasib)\nD-1553 is a selective and potent oral KRAS G12C inhibitor\ndeveloped by InvestisBio (Figure 2). It speciﬁcally binds to GDP-\nbound KRAS G12C proteins and has been shown to be inactive\nagainst KRAS wild-type (WT) and KRAS G12D cell lines (57).\nStrong speciﬁc inhibition of KRAS G12C was demonstrated in both\na cellular model and a nude mouse xenograft tumor model (58, 59).\nRecent studies have found that D-1553 not only binds to GDP-\nbound KRAS G12C but also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK\nand AKT signaling pathways, effectively blocking downstream\nsignaling in KRAS G12C mutant cells. In multiple cell line\nexperiments, D-1553 demonstrated higher potency than AMG\n510 and MRTX849. The potential for D-1553 to cause tumor\nregression was reafﬁrmed in xenograft tumor model trials. It may\nalso have a role similar to MRTX849 in targeting brain metastases\nTABLE 1\nContinued\nKRAS\nG12C inhibitors\nTrial/Trial number\nPhase\nNo. of NSCLC pts\nInterventions\nResults\nPrimary Adverse\nReactions and inci-\ndence of Grade 3 or\nHigher\nAdverse Events\nHS-10370\nHS-10370-101 (NCT05367778)\nI\n43\n400-1600mg QD (41/43)\nORR 51.2% (21/41) DCR 95.1% (39/\n41) mPFS 11.3mo (95% CI, 6.1-NA)\nElevated liver enzymes,\nanemia, diarrhea, weight gain,\ndecreased appetite,\nhypoproteinemia, nausea,\nfatigue, rash 27.3%\nBI-1823911\nNCT04973163\nI\n50-1200mg QD\nDiarrhea, nausea, vomiting\n47.1%(8/17)\nMK-1084\nNCT05067283\nI\nJNJ-74699157\nNCT04006301\nI\n5\n100-200mg QD\nTerminated early due to toxicity\nElevated serum creatine\nphosphokinase 60%\nORR (Objective Response Rate), The proportion of patients with a partial or complete response to therapy; DCR (Disease Control Rate), The percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response, and stable disease; mPFS (Median Progression-\nFree Survival), The median length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease without it getting worse; mDOR (Median Duration of Response), The median length of time that a tumor continues to respond to treatment without growth.\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n06\nTABLE 2 Clinical trials of KRAS G12C inhibitors combined with pathway-targeted agents in NSCLC.\nKRAS G12C inhibitors\nMechanism of Action\nDrugs\nTrial number\nPhase\nAMG 510\nChemotherapy\nCisplatin/Carboplatin + Pemetrexed\nNCT05118854\nII\nCarboplatin + Pemetrexed\nNCT04185883\nIb\nAnti-EGFR antibody\nPanitumumab\nNCT05993455\nII\nTarloxotinib\nNCT05313009\nIb/II\nEGFR-TKI\nAfatinib\nNCT04185883\nIb\nSHP2 inhibitor\nRMC-4630\nNCT05054725\nII\nJAB-3312\nNCT04720976\nI/IIa\nERAS-601\nNCT04959981\nIb\nBBP-398\nNCT05480865\nI\nRAF/MEK inhibitor\nAvutometinib\nNCT05074810\nI/II\nMEK inhibitor\nTrametinib\nNCT04185883\nIb\nERK inhibitor\nASN-007\nNCT04959981\nIb\nmTOR inhibitor\nEverolimus\nNCT04185883\nIb\nMRTX849\nChemotherapy\nCisplatin/Carboplatin + Pemetrexed\nNCT05609578\nII\nAnti-EGFR antibody\nCetuximab\nNCT06024174\nI/II\nEGFR-TKI\nAfatinib\nNCT03785249\nI/II\nSHP2 inhibitor\nTNO155\nNCT04330664\nI/II\nRMC-4630\nNCT04418661\nI/II\nBMS-986466\nNCT06024174\nI/II\nSOS1 inhibitor\nMRTX0902\nNCT05578092\nI/II\nRAF/MEK inhibitor\nAvutometinib\nNCT05375994\nI/II\nmTOR inhibitor\nSirolimus\nNCT05840510\nI/II\nCDK4/6 inhibitor\nPalbociclib\nNCT05178888\nI/Ib\nFAK inhibitors\nKO-2806\nNCT06026410\nI\nD-1553\nSHP2 inhibitor\nGH21\nNCT06435455\nIb/II\nFAK inhibitors\nIfebemtinib\nNCT05379946\nIb/II\nNCT06166836\nI/II\nIBI351\nAnti-EGFR antibody\nCetuximab\nNCT05756153\nII\nJAB-21822\nSHP2 inhibitor\nJAB-3312\nNCT05288205\nI/IIa\nNCT06416410\nIII\nJDQ443\nAnti-EGFR antibody\nCetuximab\nNCT05358249\nIb/II\nSHP2 inhibitor\nTNO155\nNCT04699188\nIb/II\nMEK inhibitor\nTrametinib\nNCT05358249\nIb/II\nCDK4/6 inhibitor\nRibociclib\nNCT05358249\nIb/II\nLY3537982\nChemotherapy\nCisplatin/Carboplatin + Pemetrexed\nNCT04956640\nI/II\nGDC-6036\nAnti-EGFR antibody\nCetuximab\nNCT04449874\nIa/Ib\nEGFR-TKI\nAfatinib\nNCT04449874\nIa/Ib\nSHP2 inhibitor\nMigoprotaﬁb\nNCT04449874\nIa/Ib\n(Continued)\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n07\n(57). These ﬁndings suggest that D-1553 could be a promising\nKRAS G12C inhibitor. Clinical trials targeting D-1553 are also\nongoing and have shown promising anti-tumor activity in patients\nwith NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations in phase I studies (60).\nResults from the phase II study were recently published. This study\nenrolled patients with advanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C\nmutations who had received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and\nplatinum-based chemotherapy, administering D-1553 at a dose of\n600 mg QD. Among 123 treated patients, the ORR was 50%, the\nDCR was 88.6%, the median DOR was 12.78 months, and the\nmedian PFS was 7.56 months, with the median OS not yet reached.\nTRAEs were reported in 95% of patients, with grade 3 or higher\nevents in 50%. No TRAEs led to the discontinuation of D-1553, and\nmost adverse events were well-managed (14, 61). D-1553 has\ndemonstrated high tumor response rates and long-term remission\ndurations. With a Phase III trial comparing it to docetaxel currently\nrecruiting patients, D-1553’s favorable efﬁcacy is expected\nto continue.\nIn addition to monotherapy, D-1553 has also demonstrated\ntherapeutic potential in combination with other agents. Focal\nadhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors show promise in combination\nwith KRAS inhibitors. A Phase II study combining D-1553 with the\nFAK inhibitor Ifebemtinib in treatment-naive NSCLC patients with\nKRAS G12C mutations reported an ORR of 87.5% and a DCR of\n93.8%, with no additional toxicity compared to monotherapy (62).\nThese results highlight excellent efﬁcacy and safety, offering\npotential for further KRAS-G12C inhibitor development.\n3.3.2 IBI351 (GFH925)\nIBI351 is a novel KRAS G12C inhibitor developed by Innovent\nBiologics (Figure 2). In phase I trials involving patients with\nadvanced solid tumors, IBI351 demonstrated promising efﬁcacy\nand tolerability (63). The latest update on monotherapy in\nmetastatic colorectal cancer(CRC) indicates hopeful and durable\nefﬁcacy with manageable safety (64). Preliminary results from the\nphase II trial for patients with advanced NSCLC have also been\npromising (15, 65). As of December 13, 2023, among the 116\nadvanced NSCLC patients participating in the treatment trial, the\nORR was 49.1%, and the DCR was 90.5%. The median DOR has not\nbeen reached, and the median PFS was 9.7 months. TRAEs occurred\nin 92.2% of the patients, with 41.4% experiencing TRAEs of grade\n≥3 (15). During the analysis of the tumor mutation proﬁles of\ntreated patients, researchers identiﬁed TP53, STK11, and KEAP1 as\nthe most common co-mutated genes with KRAS G12C. Co-\nmutations involving genes like STK11 and KEAP1 were\nassociated with poorer PFS (15). It is hypothesized that selectively\nusing KRAS G12C inhibitors based on patient gene co-mutation\nstatus might enhance the efﬁcacy of these inhibitors, and further\nstudies are anticipated to validate this hypothesis.\nIBI351 is gaining attention for its potential in combination\ntherapies beyond monotherapy. The KROCUS Phase II study\nevaluated IBI351 with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in\nKRAS G12C-mutated patients, reporting an ORR of 80% and a\nDCR of 100% among 20 evaluable patients, including an ORR of\n71.4% in those with brain metastases. The combination\ndemonstrated manageable safety, with 18.5% of patients\nexperiencing grade 3 TRAEs and no grade 4 or 5 events (66).\nWhile the results highlight strong efﬁcacy and safety, larger studies\nare needed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings.\n3.3.3 JAB-21822 (Glecirasib)\nIn early preclinical studies, JAB-21822 exhibited strong inhibitory\neffects on cell growth as a monotherapy across various human cancer\ncell lines (Figure 2) (67). In phase I/II studies targeting patients with\nadvanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, JAB-21822\ndemonstrated good tolerability and signiﬁcant preliminary efﬁcacy\n(68). A recent phase II study in China involved 119 patients with\nadvanced NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations, who received 800 mg\nof JAB-21822 daily as monotherapy. The study showed an ORR of\n47.9%, a DCR of 86.3%, a median PFS of 8.2 months, and a median OS\nof 13.6 months. The median DOR has not yet been reached. TRAEs of\nany grade were observed in 97.5% of patients, with the most common\nbeing anemia and increased blood bilirubin levels (16). Despite the\nrelatively high incidence of TRAEs, JAB-21822 exhibited very low\ngastrointestinal toxicity, which is an advantage over other KRAS G12C\ninhibitors and may enhance patient adherence to oral therapy.\nJAB-21822 combined with the SHP2 inhibitor JAB-3312 has\nshown synergistic effects in KRAS G12C inhibitor-resistant tumors\n(67). In NSCLC patients, ﬁrst-line combination therapy achieved an\nORR of 64.7% and a DCR of 93.1%, with a median PFS of 12.2\nmonths in 102 patients (69). Efﬁcacy was consistent across different\nPD-L1 expression levels, with ORRs ranging from 46.2% to 82.4%\nand median PFS values from 8.1 to 15 months. Grade ≥3 TRAEs\noccurred in 43.8% of patients, including anemia, elevated liver\nenzymes, and hypertriglyceridemia (69). A Phase III trial is\nongoing to further evaluate this promising regimen.\n3.3.4 JDQ443\nJDQ443 is a novel KRAS G12C inhibitor featuring a unique 5-\nmethylpyrazole core and a spiro-azolide linker (Figure 2). This\ninhibitor forms novel interactions with speciﬁc residues in the SW-\nII pocket of KRAS G12C, bypassing the H95 residue, thereby\ndurably and irreversibly immobilizing KRAS G12C in a GDP-\nbound inactive state. This represents a different binding mode\nTABLE 2 Continued\nKRAS G12C inhibitors\nMechanism of Action\nDrugs\nTrial number\nPhase\nPI3Ka inhibitor\nInavolisib\nNCT04449874\nIa/Ib\nBI-1823911\nPan-KRAS inhibitor\nBI-1701963\nNCT04973163\nIa/Ib\nFor each combination therapy regimen, the target, therapeutic agents, trial identiﬁer, and trial phase are speciﬁed.\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n08\nFIGURE 2\nChemical structures of KRAS G12C inhibitors.

In\nvivo studies have shown that JDQ443 achieves superior target\noccupancy, demonstrating favorable oral bioavailability and dose-\ndependent antitumor activity, as well as tolerability across various\nin vitro and in vivo models (71, 72). Moreover, studies suggest that\nJDQ443 may reverse resistance to other KRAS G12C inhibitors like\nMRTX849 (72). Relevant clinical studies of JDQ443 are underway.\nKontRASt-01 (NCT04699188) is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter clinical\nstudy evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efﬁcacy of JDQ443.\nRecent data indicate that 84 patients received JDQ443\nmonotherapy, including 38 cases of NSCLC. At the recommended\nPhase I dose of 200 mg BID, 71.4% of patients experienced TRAEs\nof varying grades, with 7.1% experiencing Grade 3 TRAEs, and no\nGrade 4-5 TRAEs observed. The ORR for NSCLC patients at the\nrecommended dose was 54.5% (73). The KontRASt-06\n(NCT05445843) Phase II study is evaluating JDQ443\nmonotherapy as a ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with advanced\nNSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations. The study includes two\ngroups: one with tumor PD-L1 expression of less than 1%\nregardless of STK11 mutation status, and the other with PD-L1\nexpression of greater than or equal to 1% with STK11 co-mutation.\nThe study is currently enrolling participants (74). The KontRASt-02\nPhase III study aims to compare the efﬁcacy of JDQ443\nmonotherapy against docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC\nwith KRAS G12C mutations and is also recruiting participants (75).\nJDQ443 combined with the SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 has shown\npotential to enhance therapeutic outcomes (71). In the KontRASt-01\nstudy, among 24 NSCLC patients previously treated with a KRAS\nG12C inhibitor, the combination achieved an ORR of 33.3% and a\nDCR of 66.7%. TRAEs occurred in 88% of patients, with grade 3-4\nTRAEs in 36% (76). Preclinical studies are also exploring combinations\nwith SHP2 and MEK inhibitors, highlighting the potential of JDQ443\nin combination therapies to improve efﬁcacy (77).\n3.3.5 LY3537982 (Olomorasib)\nLY3537982 is a novel, orally available KRAS G12C inhibitor\ncharacterized by unique pharmacological properties that achieve\nhigh target occupancy at low concentrations, offering higher\ninhibition efﬁciency of KRAS G12C compared to AMG 510 and\nMRTX849 (Figure 2). In the KRAS G12C-mutated H358 lung\ncancer cell line, LY3537982 exhibited signiﬁcantly lower IC50\nvalues for the inhibition of GTP-bound KRAS and\nphosphorylated ERK than the other two KRAS G12C inhibitors,\nunderscoring its potent tumor growth inhibition effect (78). The\nLOXO-RAS-20001 study (NCT04956640), a Phase I trial\ninvestigating LY3537982 in patients with advanced solid tumors\nharboring KRAS G12C mutations, reported a favorable safety\nproﬁle across various solid tumors, including NSCLC, CRC, and\nPANC. Patients receiving multiple dose gradients (50-200 mg BID)\nexperienced no serious adverse events or deaths related to treatment\n(79). Recent data from a Phase I study of LY3537982 in patients\nwith gastrointestinal tumors highlighted its preliminary efﬁcacy and\nfavorable safety both as a monotherapy and in combination with\ncyclosporine (80). These ﬁndings suggest LY3537982’s potential in\nboth standalone and combination chemotherapeutic regimens.\nUpdated results from the LOXO-RAS-20001 study as of October\n30, 2023, included 157 patients (58 NSCLC, 32 CRC, 24 PANC, 43\nother solid tumors) receiving LY3537982 (50-200 mg BID PO).\nNotably, among 29 NSCLC patients previously treated with KRAS\nG12C inhibitors, the ORR was 39%, with a DCR of 73% and a\nmedian PFS of 6 months. TRAEs occurred in 62% of patients, with\nthe most common being diarrhea (24%), fatigue (10%), and nausea\n(10%) (81). These results afﬁrm the preliminary efﬁcacy and safety\nof LY3537982 and help ﬁll the clinical trial void for this drug in\nNSCLC patients. The Phase II trial is currently recruiting, and the\nresults are promising. For advanced NSCLC, combination therapies\ninvolving LY3499446 with EGFR-TKIs and CDK4/6 inhibitors have\nalso entered clinical trial phases, showing potential for enhanced\ntherapeutic strategies.\n3.3.6 GDC-6036 (divarasib)\nGDC-6036 is a highly effective and selective inhibitor targeting\nthe KRAS G12C mutation. It features a highly reactive acrylamide\nwarhead and two densely functionalized heterocycles: quinoline and\npyridine. Its structure includes a bulky, rotationally restricted C−C\nbond (Figure 2) (82). Previous studies have demonstrated that\nGDC-6036 exhibits dose-dependent tumor inhibition in xenograft\nmodels using pancreatic cancer cell lines. Further research has\nrevealed that GDC-6036 can inhibit KRAS G12C alkylation and\nMAPK signaling pathway activity in a dose-dependent manner\n(83). GDC-6036 has shown promising clinical activity and high\ntarget occupancy in solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutations, with\na safety proﬁle within controllable limits (84). The latest Phase I\nstudy data indicate that among 60 NSCLC patients receiving GDC-\n6036 treatment at oral doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg, the ORR\nwas 53.4%. A conﬁrmed therapeutic response was observed in\n53.4% of patients, with a median PFS of 13.1 months. Responses\nwere also observed in other solid tumor patients within this cohort.\nTreatment-related adverse events occurred in 93% of patients, with\nno dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related deaths reported\n(85). Additionally, a decrease in the KRAS G12C variant allele\nfrequency, as assessed through sequencing of circulating tumor\nDNA, was associated with response (85). In colorectal cancer,\ncombining GDC-6036 with cetuximab demonstrated antitumor\nactivity, while studies are ongoing to explore combinations with\nchemotherapy, bevacizumab, GDC-1971 (SHP2 inhibitor), and\ninavolisib (PI3Ka inhibitor) (86). Notably, in KRAS G12C-\nmutant NSCLC models, GDC-6036 combined with GDC-1971\nreduced tumor growth more effectively than either drug alone\nand was well-tolerated (87). The efﬁcacy of combining GDC-6036\nwith additional drugs in NSCLC warrants further investigation.\nSeveral novel KRAS G12C inhibitors are currently under\ninvestigation. BI-1823911, a novel inhibitor, has demonstrated\nefﬁcacy comparable to 100 mg/kg doses of AMG 510 and\nMRTX849 in NSCLC and CRC mouse models when administered\norally at 60 mg/kg daily (88). In an ongoing Phase I trial, patients\nwith advanced solid tumors are receiving ascending doses of BI-\n1823911 monotherapy. Preliminary results show clinical activity,\nwith disease control observed in 11 out of 17 patients during the\nearly dose-escalation phase (≤100 mg), and an acceptable safety\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n10\nproﬁle (89). In combination studies, the SOS1 inhibitor BI-1701963\npaired with BI-1823911 has shown synergistic antitumor effects in\npreclinical NSCLC models, and related clinical trials are ongoing\n(88, 90). The 2024 AACR conference presented results from the\nPhase I study HS-10370-101 of the KRAS G12C inhibitor HS-\n10370. The study included 55 patients with advanced solid tumors,\nof which 43 were NSCLC patients. Across all solid tumor patients,\nthe ORR was 49.0%, and the DCR was 89.8%. In NSCLC patients\nreceiving daily doses of ≥400 mg, the ORR was 51.2% and the DCR\nwas 95.1%, with the median PFS at 11.3 months and a 6-month PFS\nrate of 75%. Among the 55 patients, 87.3% experienced TRAEs, and\n27.3% experienced grade 3 or higher TRAEs, with common adverse\nevents including elevated AST, elevated ALT, anemia, diarrhea, and\nweight gain (91). Merck’s MK-1084 showcased encouraging efﬁcacy\nand a manageable safety proﬁle in its Phase I trial presented at the\n2024 ESMO Congress. In the monotherapy cohort, the drug\nachieved an ORR of 22% in patients with colorectal cancer,\nNSCLC, and cervical adenocarcinoma. The treatment was well-\ntolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities reported (92). However,\nsome drug development processes have faced challenges. JNJ-\n74699157 did not demonstrate signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁts during\ndose-escalation trials, and dose-limiting skeletal muscle toxicity was\nobserved, leading to the halt of further development (93).\n4 Exploration of resistance\nmechanisms to KRAS G12C inhibitors\nDespite the initial success of KRAS G12C inhibitors, resistance\nhas emerged as a signiﬁcant challenge, driven by diverse mechanisms\nsuch as secondary KRAS mutations, MET ampliﬁcation, and bypass\npathway alterations (94). Acquired resistance, which develops during\ntreatment through adaptive genetic and cellular changes, remains a\nkey barrier to sustained efﬁcacy. This section highlights acquired\nresistance mechanisms and their implications for improving\ntherapeutic strategies.\n4.1 Secondary KRAS mutations and\nampliﬁcations\nSecondary KRAS mutations, including alterations such as\nY96D/S, G13D, and Q99L, represent a crucial mechanism of\nacquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors (95). Among these,\nthe KRASY96D mutation disrupts the switch-II pocket essential for\ninactive-state inhibitor binding, conferring cross-resistance to\nmultiple KRASG12C inhibitors (94). Functional studies reveal\ndifferential susceptibility proﬁles among resistant clones—certain\nsecondary mutations (e.g., Q99L) exhibit inhibitor-speciﬁc\nresistance patterns, suggesting potential utility in sequential\ntherapeutic strategies (96). Emerging approaches demonstrate\npreclinical efﬁcacy against these resistance mechanisms: the\nactive-state inhibitor RM-018 maintains activity against KRAS\nG12C/Y96D, while BI-3406 (SOS1 inhibitor) combined with\ntrametinib effectively targets Y96D/S-mediated resistance (97).\nIn addition to these secondary mutations, KRAS G12C\nampliﬁcation also contributes signiﬁcantly to resistance by\nsaturating KRAS G12C inhibitors through oncogene overload.\nGiven the intrinsically high intracellular GTP: GDP ratio (~10:1),\nKRAS G12C ampliﬁcation elevates total KRAS protein levels,\ndisproportionately increasing GTP-bound active KRAS (94, 98).\nThis increase in active KRAS offsets the inhibitory effects of KRAS\nG12C inhibitors, allowing the RAS-MAPK pathway to remain active.\n4.2 RTK activation and compensatory\nsignaling pathways\nActivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is a major driver\nof resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors. Genetic alterations, including\nampliﬁcation of EGFR, MET, and RET, as well as oncogenic fusions\nsuch as EML4-ALK and CCDC6-RET, reactivate the RAS-MAPK\nsignaling pathway by restoring RTK pathway activity (94, 99).\nNotably, EGFR overexpression not only sustains the GTP-binding\nactivity of KRAS G12C but also promotes resistance by activating\nwild-type RAS isoforms (HRAS/NRAS), leading to reactivation of the\nRAF-MEK-ERK cascade in a “two-pronged” resistance model (100).\nPreclinical studies have revealed that subclonal MET ampliﬁcation in\nKRAS G12C inhibitor-resistant cells facilitates the conversion of RAS\nfrom its inactive GDP-bound state to its active GTP-bound state,\nthereby reactivating downstream signaling (101). In NSCLC cells,\nMET ampliﬁcation not only induced RAS-mediated MEK-ERK\nactivation but also activated the AKT pathway independently of\nRAS (101). Importantly, the MET inhibitor crizotinib effectively\nsuppressed the RAS-MEK-ERK and AKT signaling pathways,\nrestoring sensitivity to AMG 510 and achieving tumor regression\nin AMG 510-resistant xenograft models, underscoring the\ntherapeutic potential of combining these agents (101). Additionally,\ngenetic alterations such as RET ampliﬁcation and oncogenic fusions,\nincluding EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET, and TACC3-FGFR3, can\ndirectly reactivate the MAPK pathway, thereby driving drug\nresistance (94, 99). Targeting these alterations following the\ndevelopment of resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors represents a\npromising avenue for future research and therapeutic development.\nResistance to KRASG12C inhibitors is not limited to mutations\nin the RAS-MAPK pathway but also involves signiﬁcant\nreprogramming of compensatory signaling pathways. One key\nmechanism is the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway\n(95), driven by alterations such as gain-of-function PIK3CA\nmutations (e.g., H1047R) or PTEN loss, which lead to increased\nPI3K signaling and promote cell survival through the AKT-mTOR\npathway. As previously mentioned, MET ampliﬁcation drives\nresistance by activating both the PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT3\npathways, providing alternative survival mechanisms. Preclinical\nstudies have shown that combining MET inhibitors (e.g., crizotinib)\nwith KRASG12C inhibitors can block these pathways and\nsigniﬁcantly delay the development of resistance (101).\nRTK-mediated compensatory activation and intrinsic variations\nwithin compensatory signaling pathways create a dynamic network\nof resistance mechanisms. Addressing this challenge necessitates a\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n11\ncombination of precise targeted therapies and continuous\nmonitoring of tumor heterogeneity.\n4.3 Co-mutations, histologic\ntransformation, and EMT\nRecent advances in understanding resistance mechanisms have\nuncovered additional factors inﬂuencing the efﬁcacy of KRASG12C\ninhibitors, including co-mutations, histologic transformation, and\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Clinical studies have\nshown that concurrent mutations in KEAP1, SMARCA4, and\nCDKN2A are strongly associated with poor therapeutic responses to\nKRASG12C inhibitor monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC\n(102). Similarly, preclinical studies using KRAS G12C-mutant mouse\nmodels with STK11/LKB1 deletions have identiﬁed adenocarcinoma-\nto-squamous cell carcinoma transformation (AST) as a pathological\nfeature linked to primary drug resistance (103). This histologic\ntransition may contribute to the poor clinical outcomes observed in\nKRAS G12C/STK11 co-mutated patients and represents a potential\ntherapeutic target for overcoming resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors.\nFurthermore, EMT is a well-recognized mechanism of adaptive drug\nresistance and subsequent cancer treatment failure. Studies have\ndemonstrated that EMT may drive resistance to KRASG12C\ninhibitors through hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway (104).\nConsequently, strategies aimed at promoting mesenchymal-to-\nepithelial transition (MET) hold promise for overcoming this\nresistance. Additionally, immune factors may contribute to this\nprocess, and we will discuss how these immune factors are involved\nin the mechanisms of resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors.\nIn conclusion, these ﬁndings underscore the multifactorial nature\nof drug resistance, offering valuable insights for developing predictive\nbiomarkers and designing effective combination therapies.\n5 The impact of KRAS mutations on\nthe TME\nAfter examining the mechanisms of resistance to KRAS G12C\ninhibitors, it becomes essential to investigate how KRAS mutations\ninﬂuence the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). These\nmutations can trigger immune evasion, signiﬁcantly affecting\ntherapeutic efﬁcacy (Figure 3). In the subsequent sections, we will\ndelve into the effects of KRAS mutations on immunity and their\nimplications for therapeutic strategies.\n5.1 Modulation of immune checkpoints by\noncogenic KRAS\nImmune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-\n4, are critical mediators of tumor immune escape, enabling tumor\ncells to evade immune surveillance by binding to receptors on T cells\nand suppressing their activity. Emerging evidence indicates that\nKRAS mutations signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the expression and function\nof immune checkpoint molecules by modulating speciﬁc signaling\npathways (Figure 3). In a pivotal study, Chen et al. revealed\nsigniﬁcantly elevated PD-L1 expression levels in both tumor tissues\nand cell lines derived from KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma\npatients, compared to their KRAS-wild-type, EGFR-mutated, and\nALK-mutated counterparts (105). Mechanistically, the researchers\nidentiﬁed that KRAS modulates PD-L1 expression speciﬁcally\nthrough the p-ERK signaling pathway, with minimal contribution\nfrom p-AKT (105). A seminal study has unveiled a profound and\npreviously unrecognized mechanism involving Tristetraprolin (TTP),\nan AU-rich element (ARE)-binding protein, in the regulation of PD-\nL1 expression. TTP typically binds to AREs within the 3’ untranslated\nregion (3’ UTR) of PD-L1 mRNA, thereby enhancing PD-L1 mRNA\nstability and negatively regulating PD-L1 expression (106). Notably,\nin the context of oncogenic KRAS mutations, the constitutively\nactivated MEK signaling pathway induces TTP phosphorylation at\nspeciﬁc serine residues, leading to its functional inactivation and\nsubsequent dysregulation of PD-L1 expression (106). This intricate\nmolecular crosstalk between KRAS-driven signaling and TTP-\nmediated post-transcriptional regulation not only provides novel\ninsights into the mechanisms of immune evasion in NSCLC but\nalso highlights potential therapeutic targets for modulating PD-L1\nexpression in KRAS-mutant tumors.\nWhile the PD-1/PD-L1 axis remains a cornerstone of immune\ncheckpoint regulation, accumulating evidence highlights the signiﬁcant\ncontribution of alternative inhibitory pathways in shaping the\nimmunosuppressive TME of NSCLC. Emerging research particularly\nimplicates lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), cytotoxic T-\nlymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and T-cell\nimmunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein-3 (TIM-3)\nas critical mediators of immune evasion (107). LAG-3 emerges as a\ncentral regulatory element - this activation-induced inhibitory receptor\nmodulates immune homeostasis through coordinated suppression of\nCD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation and effector functions (108).\nMechanistic studies have established FGL1 as the principal functional\nligand mediating LAG-3-dependent immunosuppression, with their\ninteraction demonstrating potent inhibition of antigen-speciﬁc T-cell\nactivation (Figure 3) (109). Recent studies reveal a marked inverse\ncorrelation between FGL1 expression levels and CD8+ T-cell\ninﬁltration density in KRAS-mutant LUAD (110). Mechanistically,\noncogenic KRAS mutations activate the ERK1/2-SET1A signaling axis,\nleading to the sequential phosphorylation, stabilization, and nuclear\nlocalization of SET1A. In the nucleus, SET1A catalyzes YAP\nmethylation, an epigenetic modiﬁcation that drives its nuclear\nretention and enhances YAP-mediated transcriptional activation of\nFGL1 (110). This cascade establishes a pro-immunosuppressive tumor\nmicroenvironment, ultimately contributing to immune evasion in\nKRAS-mutant LUAD. Recent ﬁndings from studies in lung cancer\ncell lines and mouse models further elucidate this mechanism,\ndemonstrating that the KRAS-ERK1/2-SET1A-YAP axis is central to\nFGL1 upregulation and the resulting immune escape phenotype (110).\nNotably, colorectal carcinomas with KRAS mutations display a distinct\nimmunoregulatory proﬁle, marked by the pronounced downregulation\nof immune checkpoints such as BTLA, CTLA-4, and TIGIT—a pattern\nin sharp contrast to that observed in pulmonary malignancies (111).\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n12\nThis tissue-speciﬁc divergence underscores the pivotal role of the\ntumor’s originating microenvironment in shaping KRAS-driven\nimmune checkpoint regulation.\n5.2 Signaling pathways mediating immune\nevasion in KRAS-mutant tumors\n5.2.1 Ras-MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in\nimmune evasion\nIn addition to directly regulating immune checkpoint\nexpression, KRAS-mutated tumor cells have been shown to\nenhance the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-b1 through activation of\nthe MEK-ERK-AP1 signaling pathway (112). These cytokines play\npivotal roles in suppressing effector T cell activity and promoting\nthe differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Figure 3) (113).\nSilencing KRAS expression signiﬁcantly reduces the secretion of\nthese cytokines, accompanied by a marked decrease in Treg\nproduction (112). Interestingly, the Ras-MAPK pathway ampliﬁes\nparacrine crosstalk between malignant cells and stromal\ncomponents through CAF differentiation. Oncogenic RAS\nsignaling facilitates CAF transformation via TGF-b-mediated\nmechanisms, with CAF-secreted CXCL5 subsequently activating\nthe Ras-MAPK axis to upregulate PD-L1 expression and drive\nimmune evasion (114, 115).\nPI3K signaling maintains immunoregulatory potential in KRAS-\ndriven tumors via distinct mechanisms. In KRAS G12D models,\nactivation of the P70S6K-PI3K-AKT axis downregulates HMGA2\nexpression, correlating inversely with reduced CXCL10/CXCL11\nchemokine production that impairs CD8+ T cell inﬁltration and\nantitumor immunity (116). Furthermore, this pathway facilitates\nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) recruitment through\nupregulated GM-CSF production, fostering an immunosuppressive\nniche via T-cell suppression (117). However, current evidence\nremains constrained to KRAS G12D preclinical models, creating\ncritical knowledge gaps regarding PI3K pathway functions in KRAS\nG12C-driven malignancies that require systematic investigation.\n5.2.2 NF-kB, STAT3, and IFN pathways in immune\nevasion\nKRAS-driven tumors employ multifaceted signaling networks that\nextend beyond canonical RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways to\ninclude NF-kB, STAT, and interferon axes, each exerting critical\nimmunoregulatory effects. KRAS mutations systematically orchestrate\nan immunosuppressive microenvironment through RAL-TBK1-IKKe-\nmediated NF-kB activation, driving IL-6 production that promotes\nFIGURE 3\nUpper Section, Persistently activated downstream signaling pathways of mutant KRAS. Lower Section, Tumor microenvironment inﬂuenced by\nmutant KRAS.\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n13\naccumulation of Tregs and protumorigenic macrophages while\nsuppressing CD8+ T-cell effector functions (118, 119). In lung\nadenocarcinoma patient samples and KRAS-driven lung cancer\nmouse models, KRAS mutations engage PI3K/STAT3 axis activation\nto suppress miR-34a, resulting in transcriptional depression of the\n“don’t eat me” signal CD47. This weakens macrophage-mediated\nphagocytosis and promotes immune escape (Figure 3) (120).\nTherapeutic disruption of this axis through KRAS G12C inhibitors\nor CD47-neutralizing antibodies restores phagocytic competence,\neffectively reprogramming the immune contexture from immune-\nevasive to immune-responsive states (120).\nComplementing these mechanisms, in KRAS-driven\nmalignancies, suppression of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway\nemerges as a critical mechanism of tumor immune evasion, with\npathway inactivation demonstrating strong correlation with\nconcurrent activation of oncogenic signaling networks such as\nMYC (121). Current evidence indicates that type I IFN signaling\ndeﬁciency manifests during early tumorigenesis in KRAS-mutant\nneoplasms and persists throughout disease progression (122).\nMechanistic studies reveal that KRAS-MYC synergistic oncogenesis\npromotes MYC-mediated transcriptional repression of IFN-regulated\ngenes (IRF5, IRF7, STAT1, STAT2) through formation of the MYC-\nMIZ1 inhibitory complex (121). Furthermore, MYC activation exerts\ndual immunosuppressive effects by downregulating JAK2 expression,\nthereby attenuating both type I and type II IFN signaling cascades\nand diminishing tumor cell responsiveness to interferon stimulation\n(123). Restoring IFN activity via STING agonists or IFN-b\nadministration reverses immunosuppressive microenvironments by\nconverting “cold” to “hot” tumor phenotypes, enhances B/NK cell\ninﬁltration, and synergizes with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade,\ndemonstrating improved prognosis in preclinical models (122, 123).\n5.3 KRAS mutations reprogram the tumor\nimmune microenvironment\n5.3.1 Reshape cytokine and chemokine proﬁles to\ndrive immune suppression\nKRAS mutations profoundly reshape the TME by inducing the\naberrant expression of cytokines and chemokines, leading to the\nsuppression of effector immune cell functions (Figure 3). The\nCXCR2 signaling axis plays a pivotal role in this process, with the\nexpression of multiple CXCR2 ligands (CXCL1/2/3/5/8)\nsigniﬁcantly elevated in KRAS mutant tumors, each contributing\ndistinct immunosuppressive functions (124). CXCL8 (IL-8), a direct\ntranscriptional target of KRAS, is strongly associated with tumor-\nassociated inﬂammation and angiogenesis (125). Similarly, CXCL3\nis upregulated due to KRAS-mediated inhibition of interferon\nregulatory factor 2 (IRF2), which exacerbates the recruitment of\nMDSCs in colorectal cancer (126). Additionally, SOX2-driven\nupregulation of CXCL5 in NSCLC promotes the accumulation of\ntumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), accelerating tumor\nprogression (127). Together, these CXCR2 chemokines facilitate\nTANs and MDSCs recruitment into the TME, impairing CD8+ T\ncell function and contributing to immune suppression (124).\nIn parallel, KRAS mutations promote immune evasion through\nactivation of the COX2/PGE2 signaling axis. PGE2 directly\nsuppresses CD8+ T cell activity and dendritic cell (DC) antigen-\npresenting capacity, while also driving the expansion of Tregs by\ninducing IL-10 and TGF-b secretion (128, 129). This creates a\npositive feedback loop that sustains the immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment. Moreover, KRAS mutations enhance the\nsecretion of proinﬂammatory factors such as GM-CSF, which\nexpand immunosuppressive Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid cells and\nfurther disrupt T cell-mediated immune surveillance (117).\nPreclinical studies emphasize that targeting the cytokine and\nchemokine networks, such as the CXCR2 or COX2 pathways,\neffectively reduces the immunosuppressive inﬂuence of MDSCs\nand Tregs in the TME, providing a promising strategy to\ncounteract KRAS mutation-associated immune escape (124, 128).\n5.3.2 Recruitment of immunosuppressive Cells\nKRAS mutations play a pivotal role in orchestrating an\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by promoting the\npathological recruitment of Tregs, MDSCs, and tumor-associated\nneutrophils via the upregulation of cytokine and chemokine\nexpression (117, 124, 126, 127, 129). These immunosuppressive\npopulations critically impair CD8+ T-cell inﬁltration and effector\nfunctions, thereby promoting immune evasion. In KRAS-mutant\nNSCLC, spatial multilabel analyses have demonstrated that the\nspatial interactions among immunosuppressive cells signiﬁcantly\ncontribute to resistance against ICIs. Notably, the spatial co-\nlocalization of CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)\nwith FOXP3+ Tregs has been strongly associated with reduced\nICIs efﬁcacy, with non-nuclear FOXP3 expression further\ncompromising therapeutic outcomes (130). These ﬁndings\nhighlight the complex interplay of immune components within\nthe KRAS-driven tumor microenvironment.\nIn addition, KRAS mutations directly target CD3+ T cells, a\nmajor subset within the T-cell population, thereby augmenting\nimmune escape. The induction of CD3+ T-cell apoptosis by\nKRAS mutations not only leads to T-cell depletion and energy\nstarvation but also undermines tumor immune surveillance,\nultimately facilitating immune evasion by NSCLC cells (105).\nNotably, KRAS mutations upregulate PD-L1 expression and\ninduce CD3+ T-cell apoptosis through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis,\nfurther reinforcing their central role in escaping immune\ndestruction (105).\nIn conclusion, KRAS mutations profoundly reshape the TME\nthrough complex, multilayered interactions across diverse cell\ntypes. This remodeling enhances tumor immune evasion and\nposes signiﬁcant challenges to the efﬁcacy of immunotherapy.\n5.4 KRAS co-mutations and tumor immune\nmicroenvironment regulation\nSTK11/LKB1 (KL), TP53 (KP), and CDKN2A/B inactivation\ncombined with low NKX2-1 expression (KC) represent the major\nco-mutation patterns in KRAS-mutated NSCLC, each associated\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n14\nwith distinct TME characteristics and differential responses to\ntreatment (131). Among these, the KL subgroup exhibits an\n‘immune-cold’ phenotype, characterized by reduced PD-L1\nexpression and diminished CD8+ T-cell inﬁltration (131, 132).\nThis immunosuppressive environment is partly attributed to\nSTING pathway silencing caused by LKB1 loss, FAK signaling-\ndriven collagen deposition, and neutrophil accumulation, all of\nwhich suppress anti-tumor immunity (132–134). Additionally,\nelevated autophagic ﬂux in KL tumors impairs antigen\npresentation by disrupting immune proteasome function (134).\nMechanistic studies suggest that strategies such as using ULK1\ninhibitors to restore antigen processing or inhibiting the IL-6\npathway can each signiﬁcantly enhance the immunotherapeutic\nresponse in these tumors (134, 135). In contrast, the KP subgroup\nexhibits an ‘immune-hot’ phenotype, characterized by a high tumor\nmutational burden (TMB), elevated PD-L1 expression, and\nincreased levels of inﬂammatory markers (131). TP53 mutations\nenhance the efﬁcacy of ICIs by promoting neoantigen formation\nand activating adaptive immunity through the regulation of genes\ninvolved in DNA repair and cell cycle control (136). Furthermore,\nthe suppression of mTORC1 signaling observed in the KC subgroup\nsuggests that tumor-associated immune cells can undergo\nphenotypic and functional reprogramming within the tumor\nmicroenvironment (131, 137).\nIn addition to the previously discussed co-mutations, KRAS\nmutations in conjunction with KEAP1, Myc, and RNF43 alterations\nexert profound effects on the immune microenvironment. KEAP1\nmutations stabilize EMSY, enabling immune escape by suppressing\ntype I interferon signaling, even with increased mutational burden\n(138). Myc activation drives widespread tumor microenvironment\nremodeling, characterized by inﬂammation, angiogenesis, and\nimmune suppression, with CCL9 and IL-23 signaling mediating\neffector immune cell exclusion (139). Similarly, RNF43 mutations\nreshape the tumor immune landscape through modulation of\nchemokine pathways such as CXCL5, further reinforcing immune\nevasion (140). Overall, KRAS co-mutations regulate the tumor\nimmune microenvironment through distinct mechanisms,\nunderscoring the necessity of optimizing personalized therapeutic\nstrategies and validating their potential through preclinical studies.\n5.5 Metabolic adaptation and immune\neffects in tumor microenvironment\nKRAS mutations drive tumor survival, growth, and immune\nescape in colorectal, non-small cell lung, and pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinomas by reprogramming cancer cell metabolism and\nreshaping metabolic interactions within the tumor microenvironment\n(141). KRAS mutations have been shown to drive high lactate\nproduction, resulting in its signiﬁcant accumulation within the tumor\nmicroenvironment. This metabolic reprogramming directly triggers\nactivation-induced cell death in activated CD8+ T cells, thereby\nweakening the anti-tumor immune response (Figure 3) (142). In\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KRAS further increases\nthe metabolic demands of tumor cellsby enhancingglycolytic pathways,\nwhichexacerbateslocallactateaccumulationandcontributestoimmune\nsuppression (143). In summary, KRAS mutations reprogram\nmetabolism to suppress immunity and promote tumor immune escape.\n6 KRAS G12C inhibitors in\ncombination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy\n6.1 Immunomodulatory effects of KRAS\nG12C inhibitors\nUnderstanding the signiﬁcant impact of KRAS mutations on the\nTME underscores the need to explore therapies targeting these\nmutations. KRAS G12C inhibitors, a promising treatment option,\nnot only inhibit tumor cell proliferation but may also modulate\nimmune cell function by altering the tumor microenvironment.\nTaking AMG 510 as an example, AMG 510 treatment signiﬁcantly\nreduced tumor-inﬁltrating immunosuppressive cells, while\nenhancing the inﬁltration and activity of antigen-presenting cells\nand CD8+ T cells, thus activating adaptive anti-tumor immunity\n(31). Speciﬁcally, treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in total\nCD3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells accompanied by enhanced inﬁltration\nof macrophages and cross-presenting dendritic cells. AMG 510 also\nenhanced recruitment and activation of T cells and dendritic cells\nthrough upregulation of expression of chemokines, such as CXCL10\nand CXCL11, resulting in a signiﬁcant enhancement of immune\nsurveillance within the tumor (31). Different KRAS G12C inhibitors\nexhibited mechanistically similar immunomodulatory effects. It was\nfound that MRTX849 signiﬁcantly enhanced anti-tumor immunity\nby up-regulating the expression of MHC class I proteins and\nsuppressing immunosuppressive factors. In the KRAS G12C-\nmutated CT26 mouse model, MRTX849 reduced myeloid-derived\nsuppressor cells in the tumor, while increasing the inﬁltration of M1-\ntype macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,\ndemonstrating a signiﬁcant tumor-shrinking effect (144). A similar\nphenomenon was observed in a mouse model of in situ lung cancer,\nusing a multiplex imaging approach. similar phenomenon in a mouse\nmodel of in situ lung cancer (145). In addition to their primary\nmechanisms, KRAS G12C inhibitors have been shown to remodel the\ntumor microenvironment through additional processes. They boost\ninterferon signaling, enhancing cytotoxic T-cell activity while\nreducing the inﬁltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells (146).\nFurthermore, the inhibitors suppress COX2 and its downstream\neffector PGE2, restoring IFN-g signaling (128). Together, these\nprocesses play a key role in reshaping the tumor microenvironment\nand enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.\nHowever, prolonged use of KRAS G12C inhibitors may lead to\nthe development of adaptive immune escape mechanisms in\ntumors, representing a potential immune-related aspect of\nresistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors. For instance, AMG510-\nresistant tumors exhibit an “immune cooling” phenomenon,\ncharacterized by a substantial reduction in CD8+ T cells, a\ndecreased neoantigenic load, and an accumulation of mast cells\n(147). These changes are likely associated with KRAS-driven EMT\nand immunosuppression (148).\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n15\nIn summary, KRAS G12C inhibitors not only exert direct anti-\ntumor effects but also remodel the tumor microenvironment to\nenhance anti-tumor immunity. However, the emergence of\nadaptive immune escape mechanisms underscores the importance\nof exploring combination strategies, such as pairing KRAS G12C\ninhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, to overcome these challenges.\n6.2 The feasibility of combining KRAS G12C\ninhibitors with Anti-PD-(L)1 therapy\nEvidence indicates that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, as monotherapy or\ncombined with chemotherapy, outperform chemotherapy alone in\nadvanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC (149, 150). A retrospective analysis\nshowed that pembrolizumab signiﬁcantly improved OS and PFS\ncompared to chemotherapy. In the KRAS G12C subgroup,\npembrolizumab achieved a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.28 for OS and\n0.27 for PFS, highlighting better outcomes relative to KRAS wild-type\npatients. ORR also favored pembrolizumab in both KRAS-mutant and\nG12C subgroups (149). These ﬁndings underscore the potential of PD-\n1/PD-L1 inhibitors in KRAS-mutant NSCLC, particularly in KRAS\nG12C variants. However, resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is an\ninevitable challenge, with mechanisms broadly classiﬁed into intrinsic\nand extrinsic factors. Intrinsic resistance involves tumor-speciﬁc\nalterations, such as intracellular mutations, low tumor mutational\nburden, and antigenic escape, which reduce tumor immunogenicity\n(151). Extrinsic resistance, on the other hand, arises from immune\nevasion within the tumor microenvironment, primarily mediated by\nimmunosuppressive cells such as tumor-associated macrophages and\nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (151). As previously mentioned, the\nformation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and\ncharacteristics such as lactate accumulation in KRAS-mutant tumors\nmay limit the efﬁcacy of immune checkpoint blockade monotherapy\n(130, 142). Given the potential to reverse the immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment, there is a strong rationale to explore combination\nstrategies involving KRAS G12C inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1\ninhibitors, which may achieve synergistic effects. Notably, preclinical\nstudies have already begun investigating the feasibility of\nsuch combinations.\nIn preclinical models, KRAS G12C inhibitors have shown\nsigniﬁcant synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with\nanti-PD-1 therapy (31, 144). In immune-competent mice, AMG\n510 not only signiﬁcantly reduced tumor volume but also, when\ncombined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, produced durable\ncurative outcomes. Notably, cured mice exhibited strong adaptive\nimmune memory upon rechallenge with homozygous KRAS G12D\ntumor cells (31). Similarly, in the KRAS G12C-mutant CT26\nsyngeneic mouse model, although MRTX849 monotherapy\nsigniﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth and induced partial tumor\nregression, combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 antibody\ndramatically enhanced therapeutic efﬁcacy (144). This approach\ninduced a high proportion of durable complete responses (CRs)\nwith no recurrence upon tumor cell re-inoculation, further\nvalidating the establishment of adaptive immunity (144).\nHowever, the efﬁcacy of this synergistic anti-tumor effect\nappears to be dependent on tumor immunogenicity. In highly\nimmunogenic tumors with sufﬁcient T-cell inﬁltration,\ncombination therapy signiﬁcantly prolonged progression-free\nsurvival and achieved durable tumor clearance through enhanced\nT-cell activation and increased pro-inﬂammatory factor expression\n(146). By contrast, in low-immunogenic tumors, while KRAS G12C\ninhibitors improved antigen presentation and T-cell activation by\nremodeling the TME, these changes failed to signiﬁcantly enhance\ntumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (146).\nWorth mentioning is the spatial enrichment of Tregs in immune-\nrejecting tumors, which may play a key role in limiting the efﬁcacy of\ncombination therapy. In these tumors, although KRAS G12C\ninhibitors promoted the activation and clustering of effector T cells\n(e.g., CD8+ T cells), frequent Treg aggregation and contact with\neffector T cells formed a localized immunosuppressive barrier (152).\nExperimental depletion of Tregs signiﬁcantly improved the efﬁcacy of\nKRAS G12C inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 therapy, further\nenhancing the anti-tumor immune response (152).\nIn summary, the combination of KRAS G12C inhibitors and\nanti-PD-1 therapy demonstrated robust synergistic anti-tumor effects\nin preclinical studies, particularly in immunologically active tumors,\nby remodeling the tumor microenvironment to achieve durable\ntumor clearance and establish adaptive immune memory. However,\noptimizing immune strategies remains essential to enhance efﬁcacy in\nlow-immunogenic tumors. These ﬁndings provide a strong rationale\nand direction for clinical investigations of KRAS G12C inhibitors in\ncombination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.\n6.3 The clinical efﬁcacy of combination\ntherapy\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of\ncombining KRAS inhibitors with immunotherapy. Currently,\nmultiple KRAS G12C inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical\ntrials to explore the efﬁcacy and safety of their combination with\nanti-PD-(L)1 therapies. The results of the relevant clinical trials are\npresented in Table 3.\n6.3.1 Based on AMG 510\nIn the CodeBreak 100/101 Phase Ib clinical trial, the efﬁcacy of\ncombining AMG 510 with Pembrolizumab or Atezolizumab was\ninvestigated in 58 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC (21).\nParticipants were divided into two cohorts: the Lead-in cohort, where\npatients received AMG 510 monotherapy for 21 or 42 days before\ntransitioning to combination therapy, and the Concurrent cohort,\nwhere patients received the combination therapy from the outset.\nAcross all evaluable patients, an ORR of 29% and a DCR of 83% were\nobserved, with a median OS of 15.7 months. In the Lead-in cohort,\nthe combination of AMG 510 with Pembrolizumab resulted in an\nORR of 37%, a DCR of 74%, and a median OS that was not reached.\nConversely, the AMG 510 plus Atezolizumab group displayed an\nORR of 20%, a DCR of 90%, and a median OS of 8.1 months. In the\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n16\nConcurrent cohort, the AMG 510 with Pembrolizumab group\nexhibited an ORR of 32%, a DCR of 90%, and a median OS of 14.1\nmonths. The group combining AMG 510 with Atezolizumab had an\nORR of 20%, a DCR of 80%, and a median OS of 11.5 months. The\nincidence of grade 3-4 TRAEs in these groups was 53%, 30%, 89%,\nand 90% respectively, with increased liver enzymes being the most\ncommon TRAEs (21). Notably, the combination of AMG 510 with\nimmunotherapy did not substantially enhance efﬁcacy over AMG\n510 monotherapy, and it was associated with a higher incidence of\nsevere TRAEs. The Lead-in cohort demonstrated more enduring\nclinical efﬁcacy and a better safety proﬁle compared to the\nConcurrent cohort. These ﬁndings highlight concerns about the\npotential toxicity of combining AMG 510 with anti-PD-(L)1\ntherapies. Nonetheless, optimizing the sequence of administration\nmight improve the outcomes of this regimen. AMG 510, as one of the\nforemost drugs under development, has shown promising results as a\nmonotherapy, but further clinical evidence is necessary to ascertain\nthe feasibility of its combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies.\n6.3.2 Based on MRTX849\nSimilarly, research on MRTX849 has evaluated its combination\nwith anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in previously untreated patients with\nKRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. Recent results from the KRYSTAL-7\nPhase II study by Mirati Therapeutics indicated that ﬁrst-line\ntreatment with MRTX849 in conjunction with Pembrolizumab\npresents promising antitumor efﬁcacy and manageable safety.\nAmong 51 patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of\n≥50%, 32 achieved a conﬁrmed response, resulting in an ORR of 63%\nand a DCR of 84%, with the median PFS not reached (22). The ORR\nfor the combination therapy signiﬁcantly exceeded that of\nPembrolizumab monotherapy. Unlike AMG 510 combinations, the\nsafety proﬁle of MRTX849 and Pembrolizumab was consistent with\nTABLE 3 Clinical trials of KRAS G12C inhibitor combined with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.\nKRAS G12C\ninhibitors\nClinical tials\nAnti-PD-(L)1 drugs\nControl\nResults\nAMG510 (sotorasib)\nCodeBreak100/101\nPembrolizumab/Atezolizumab\nKRAS G12C inhibitor-naïve NSCLC\nORR 29% mDOR 17.9mo mPFS\n15.7mo (95%CI, 9.8-17.8)\nPembrolizumab\nLead in\nORR 37% (95% CI, 16-62) DCR 74%\n(95% CI, 49-91) mOS NE (95% CI,\n10.1-NE)\nPembrolizumab\nConcurrent\nORR 32% (95% CI, 13-57) DCR 90%\n(95% CI, 67-99) mOS 14.1mo (95%\nCI, 6.2-17.8)\nAtezolizumab\nLead in\nORR 20% (95% CI, 3-56) DCR 90%\n(95% CI, 56-100) mOS 8.1mo (95%\nCI, 2.5-NE)\nAtezolizumab\nConcurrent\nORR 20% (95% CI, 3-56) DCR 80%\n(95% CI, 44-98) mOS 11.5 (95% CI,\n5.0-NE)\nMRTX849 (adagrasib)\nKRYSTAL-7\nPembrolizumab\nPD-L1 TPS≥50%\nORR 63% (32/51) DCR 84% mDOR\nNE (95%CI, 12.6-NE) mPFS NE\n(95%CI, 8.2- NE)\nLY3537982\n(Olomorasib)\nLOXO-RAS-20001\nPembrolizumab\nKRAS G12C inhibitor-naïve NSCLC\nORR 78% DCR 100%\nNSCLC post-KRAS G12C\ninhibitor treatment\nORR 78% DCR 100%\nSUNRAY-\n01(NCT06119581)\nPembrolizumab\nMK-1084\nNCT05067283\nPembrolizumab\nPD-L1 TPS≥1%\nORR 71% (15/21)\nIBI351\nNCT05504278\nSintilimab\nJDQ443\nKontRASt-\n01 (NCT04699188)\nTislelizumab\nGDC-6036 (divarasib)\nKrascendo-170\nlung(NCT05789082)\nPembrolizumab\nNCT04449874\nAtezolizumab\nPatients receiving AMG 510 monotherapy for 21 or 42 days before transitioning to a combination of AMG 510 and anti-PD-(L)1 drugs; Concurrent: Patients receiving a combination of AMG\n510 and anti-PD-(L)1 drugs from the outset; PD-L1 TPS (Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Tumor Proportion Score): It represents the percentage of tumor cells showing positive staining for PD-L1.\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n17\neach monotherapy, with only 4% of patients discontinuing due to\nTRAEs (22). Based on these ﬁndings, Mirati plans to launch a Phase\nIII clinical trial to compare MRTX849 plus Pembrolizumab against\nPembrolizumab alone as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with a PD-\nL1 TPS ≥50% and KRAS G12C mutations. This trial merits\nongoing observation.\n6.3.3 Based on LY3537982\nAt the 2023 AACR Annual Meeting, results from the LOXO-\nRAS-20001 study were shared, focusing on LY3537982 combined\nwith ICIs in patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutant solid\ntumors. Speciﬁcally, LY3537982 combined with Pembrolizumab\nwas evaluated in NSCLC patients. Among KRAS G12C inhibitor-\nnaive patients, the ORR was 78% and the DCR was 100%. For\npreviously treated patients, the ORR was 25% and the DCR was\n75%. Notably, lower doses (50/100 mg BID) of LY3537982 resulted\nin a 10% incidence of grade ≥3 TRAEs, compared to 66% in the\nhigher dose group (150 mg BID), suggesting a more manageable\nsafety proﬁle at lower doses (79). Updated results from the low-dose\ncohort, including 44 patients, showed an ORR of 63% and a DCR of\n93%, with median PFS not estimable. In patients with a PD-L1 TPS\nof ≥50%, the ORR reached 75%, while those with TPS <50% or\nunknown showed an ORR of 56%. TRAEs occurring in ≥10% of\npatients included diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, fatigue, nausea,\nand itching (153). These ﬁndings underscore the signiﬁcant\npotential of LY3537982 combined with Pembrolizumab, especially\nin KRAS G12C inhibitor-naive patients and those with high PD-L1\nexpression. The ongoing SUNRAY-01 trial continues to explore\nLY3537982 and Pembrolizumab across varied PD-L1 expression\nlevels, with results highly anticipated.\n6.3.4 Based on MK-1084\nRecent clinical data from a Phase I trial assessing MK-1084 in\ncombination with Pembrolizumab in treatment-naïve patients with\nNSCLC expressing ≥1% PD-L1 revealed an ORR of 71% (92). This\ncombination therapy demonstrated signiﬁcantly improved efﬁcacy\nand a manageable safety proﬁle compared to MK-1084 monotherapy.\nTRAEs were reported in 79% of patients, with the most common\nbeing elevated ALT, elevated AST, and diarrhea. Notably, one\ninstance of dose-limiting toxicity occurred in the group receiving\n400 mg per day of MK-1084 alongside Pembrolizumab (92). While\nMK-1084 monotherapy yielded limited results, its combination with\nPembrolizumab exhibited considerable efﬁcacy. These unexpected\nﬁndings spurred Merck to initiate a Phase III randomized, double-\nblind, multicenter trial to further evaluate the efﬁcacy of MK-1084 in\ncombination with Pembrolizumab versus Pembrolizumab plus\nplacebo in previously untreated NSCLC patients with a KRAS\nG12C mutation and a PD-L1 TPS of ≥50%.\nMoreover, outcomes for several combination immunotherapy\nregimens remain undisclosed. The KONTRAST-01 (NCT04699188)\nPhase Ib/II study includes cohorts assessing JDQ443 with tislelizumab.\nConcurrently, the Krascendo-170 Lung study (NCT05789082), a Phase\nI/II trial, aims to evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of GDC-6036 with\nPembrolizumab, as well as GDC-6036 combined with Pembrolizumab,\nplatinum-based chemotherapy, and pemetrexed (154). These strategies\nof combining KRAS G12C inhibitors with anti-PD-(L)1 drugs are\nexpected to yield promising clinical outcomes, particularly important\nfor enhancing the efﬁcacy of KRAS G12C inhibitors and\novercoming resistance.\n6.4 Concerning safety issues\nAs with most combination therapies, the use of KRAS G12C\ninhibitors with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies results in increased toxicity.\nThis has been evidenced in the CodeBreaK 100/101 trials, where the\ncombination of AMG 510 with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies led to a high\nincidence of elevated liver enzymes, identiﬁed as the most common\nGrade 3-4 TRAEs. The occurrence of TRAEs was more frequent\nwith the combination therapy than with either agent alone (21). The\nspeciﬁc mechanism behind liver injury from this combination\nremains unclear. Notably, a case report by Parvin Begum et al.\ndescribed a severe immune-related hepatitis in a KRAS G12C-\nmutant NSCLC patient previously treated with anti-PD-(L)1\ntherapies and subsequently with AMG 510. This suggests that\nAMG 510 might induce a pro-inﬂammatory state, contributing to\nsuch outcomes (155). Thus, mitigating TRAEs, particularly\nhepatotoxicity, is critically important. In the CodeBreaK 100/101\ntrials, corticosteroids effectively resolved most treatment-related\nadverse events. It was observed that lower doses of AMG 510\nreduced the incidence of hepatotoxicity. Moreover, the Lead-in\ncohort experienced fewer Grade 3-4 TRAEs compared to the\nConcurrent cohort, indicating that the timing of AMG 510\ninitiation is pivotal in reducing hepatotoxicity (21). Several\nstudies have indicated that patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1\ntherapies within three months prior to AMG 510 therapy are at\nan increased risk for Grade 3 or higher TRAEs, including\nhepatotoxicity, and are more likely to discontinue treatment due\nto adverse events (156, 157). A multicenter retrospective study\nfound that patients in the Sequential group (who received anti-PD-\n(L)1 therapies as the last line before AMG 510) had a higher\nincidence of severe AMG 510-related TRAEs compared to the\ncontrol group. Severe hepatotoxicity was notably more frequent\nin the Sequential group. Additionally, patients who had their last\nanti-PD-(L)1 drugs dose within 30 days before starting AMG 510\nexperienced a higher incidence of severe TRAEs (158). Therefore,\nwhile considering efﬁcacy, the combination of AMG 510 and ICIs\nrequires further research, with optimization of dosage, sequencing,\nand timing being crucial for controlling toxic reactions.\nAttention is also focusing on the safety of other KRAS G12C\ninhibitor and anti-PD-(L)1 drug combinations. To date,\ncombinations with MRTX849, MK-1084, and LY3537982 have\ndisplayed favorable safety proﬁles. In the KRYSTAL-7 Phase II\ntrial, the combination of MRTX849 and Pembrolizumab showed a\nlow incidence of treatment-related adverse events, with only 6% of\npatients discontinuing MRTX849 and 4% discontinuing both drugs\ndue to adverse events. The incidence of elevated liver enzymes\nremained below 10% and was primarily low-grade (22). Similarly,\nthe MK-1084 plus pembrolizumab regimen demonstrated a favorable\nsafety proﬁle. In Phase I, Grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 42% of\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n18\npatients, with elevated ALT and AST being the most common. No\nGrade 5 TRAEs were observed, and the combination was generally\nwell-tolerated (92). For LY3537982 combined with Pembrolizumab,\nwhen LY3537982 was administered at 50 mg or 100 mg, the\nincidence of immune-related adverse reactions was relatively low.\nThe predominant Grade 3 or higher TRAES was diarrhea, leading to\ndiscontinuation of any drug in 9% of patients and both drugs in 9% of\npatients (153). Interestingly, LY3537982 did not exhibit stronger\nhepatotoxicity compared to other KRAS G12C inhibitors; however,\nthe small sample size necessitates larger studies for conﬁrmation.\nResearch on the combination of GDC-6036 and Pembrolizumab is\nongoing, with preliminary ﬁndings yet to be published. Addressing\nthe toxicity of combination therapies remains challenging,\nhighlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms\nunderlying these toxicities. Such research is vital to optimizing dosage\nand administration strategies to reduce adverse reactions.\n7 Future perspective\nThe unique molecular structure and signaling role of KRAS have\nhistorically posed signiﬁcant challenges in developing inhibitors\ntargeting KRAS mutations, limiting clinical treatment options.\nHowever, precision targeted therapies have advanced rapidly,\nenriching our understanding of the biological characteristics and\ntreatment strategies for NSCLC with KRAS mutations. KRAS G12C\nis the most prevalent KRAS mutation (10, 11) and, unlike other\nvariants, it maintains GTPase activity akin to wild-type KRAS (28).\nThis distinctive activation mechanism has enabled the development\nof direct inhibitors targeting KRAS G12C. Preclinical and clinical\nstudies have demonstrated promising therapeutic efﬁcacy for these\ninhibitors. Results from the CodeBreaK100 and KRYSTAL-1 clinical\ntrials led to the FDA’s approval of AMG 510 and MRTX849 for\nNSCLC patients with KRAS G12C mutations who have experienced\ndisease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy (40, 50).\nHowever, AMG 510 encountered challenges in Phase III trials, failing\nto signiﬁcantly improve overall survival compared to docetaxel, thus\nnot receiving ﬁnal market approval (13). Several new KRAS G12C\ninhibitors, such as D-1553, JDQ443, and LY3537982, are under\ndevelopment, offering unique pharmacological properties and\nmechanisms of action. These drugs have shown antitumor activity\nin preclinical studies, potentially surpassing that of AMG 510 and\nMRTX849, thereby suggesting substantial potential for further\ndevelopment (57, 70, 78). Nonetheless, resistance to KRAS G12C\ninhibitors is unavoidable, and the mechanisms underlying this\nresistance are not yet fully understood, requiring further research.\nExploring additional combination therapies is critical to overcoming\nissues of suboptimal efﬁcacy and resistance following KRAS G12C\ninhibitor treatment.\nRecently, RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors such as RMC-6236\nand RMC-7977 have shown broad-spectrum anti-RAS activity in\npreclinical studies against various RAS gene mutations, including\nKRAS codon 12 mutations (159–161). These inhibitors offer\npotential for overcoming resistance through both monotherapy and\ncombination approaches. The pan-KRAS inhibitor BI-2865 exhibits\nhigh-afﬁnity binding to various KRAS mutations, showing potential in\nselectively inhibiting KRAS-dependent cancer cell signaling. Its related\ncompound, BI-2493, has effectively suppressed tumor growth in\nKRAS-mutant models in vivo (162). A variety of inhibitors targeting\nKRAS pathway molecules have been developed, focusing on upstream\nfactors like EGFR, SOS1, and SHP2, as well as downstream elements of\nthe RAF-MEK-ERK/MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways.\nAdditionally, targeting other molecules like CDK 4/6 further\nbroadens the therapeutic approach. These inhibitors have\ndemonstrated efﬁcacy on their own and are increasingly being tested\nin combination with KRAS G12C inhibitors. This approach aims to\nimprove treatment outcomes by potentially overcoming resistance\nmechanisms and enhancing antitumor efﬁcacy (163). Notably, anti-\nEGFR antibodies, SHP2 inhibitors, and FAK inhibitors particularly\nhave shown signiﬁcant effects in clinical trials when used alongside\nKRAS G12C inhibitors (62, 66, 164). For example, the combination of\nD-1553 with the FAK inhibitor ifebemtinib demonstrated an ORR of\n87.5% and a DCR of 93.8%, indicating considerable potential (62).\nCombining KRAS G12C inhibitors with pathway-targeted inhibitors\nremains a promising avenue for future research.\nCurrent guidelines recommend chemotherapy combined with\nimmunotherapy as the ﬁrst-line treatment for advanced NSCLC\nwithout driver mutations. The introduction of immunotherapy has\nbeneﬁted patients with KRAS mutations by modifying T cell\nfunction and the immune microenvironment. These immune\neffects, post-KRAS inhibition, have been extensively studied\n(149, 165, 166). Combining KRAS G12C inhibitors with\nimmunotherapy appears feasible. Clinical trials have explored\nanti-PD-(L)1 therapy combined with drugs like AMG 510,\nMRTX849, MK-1024, and LY3537982 (21, 22, 153). Notably,\nMRTX849 with pembrolizumab achieved an ORR of 63% and a\nDCR of 84%, signiﬁcantly enhancing the efﬁcacy compared to\nMRTX849 alone (22). A ﬁrst-line treatment with LY3537982\ncombined with pembrolizumab resulted in an ORR of 78% and a\nDCR of 100%, indicating remarkable efﬁcacy (79). However, this\nimpressive efﬁcacy comes with unavoidable toxicities, particularly\nhepatotoxicity (21, 22). Addressing the toxicity of these\ncombinations without compromising efﬁcacy remains a critical\nchallenge. Current research suggests that optimizing\nadministration regimens and dosing of combination therapies\nmight partially reduce these toxicities (21). Selecting suitable drug\ncombinations based on the pharmacological properties and\nmechanisms of KRAS G12C inhibitors and anti-PD-(L)1 drugs,\nvalidated through preclinical studies, can help maximize\ntherapeutic beneﬁts while minimizing adverse effects. Overall, the\ncombination of KRAS G12C inhibitors with immunotherapy\ncontinues to hold substantial promise.\n8 Conclusion\nThe KRAS G12C mutation is a signiﬁcant driver mutation in\nnon-small cell lung cancer, with its unique biological properties and\nclinical relevance positioning it as a focal point for targeted\ntherapies. Recent advancements in targeted treatments, such as\nZhang et al.\n10.3389/fimmu.2025.1509173\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfrontiersin.org\n19\nAMG 510 and MRTX849, have shown promising efﬁcacy and\nreceived FDA approval, marking signiﬁcant progress for patients\nwith this mutation. However, despite the effectiveness of these\ninhibitors in monotherapy, the emergence of resistance\nmechanisms—such as secondary mutations and bypass signaling\nactivation—poses a considerable challenge in clinical settings.\nAdditionally, the immunomodulatory role of KRAS mutations\nwithin the tumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly\nrecognized. Studies indicate that KRAS mutations can facilitate\nimmune escape and inﬂuence patient responses to immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors by modulating the expression of immune\ncheckpoint molecules, activating downstream signaling pathways,\nand altering the inﬁltration of speciﬁc immune cells. This\nunderstanding supports the theoretical basis for combining KRAS\nG12C inhibitors with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Recent clinical data\ndemonstrate that this combination can yield synergistic effects in\ncertain patients, enhancing the objective response rate and\nprolonging progression-free survival. Nonetheless, further\nexploration is needed regarding the safety of this combination\ntherapy, optimal dosage regimens, and effective biomarker screening.\nFuture research should focus on the immune effects of KRAS\nG12C mutations, mechanisms of drug resistance, and strategies to\noptimize combination therapies. Moreover, tailored therapeutic\napproaches that consider individual patient characteristics—such\nas genomic factors and the immune microenvironment—are\nanticipated to enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy. As more clinical trial\ndata are generated and novel treatment methods are developed, the\nprospects for patients with KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC look\nincreasingly promising.\nAuthor contributions\nFZ: Conceptualization, Visualization, Writing – original draft,\nWriting – review & editing.

Due to their low incidence rate and the short \nsurvival time of patients, there is currently a lack of consensus \non the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, as well as a \ndeficiency in genomic analyses and research into the pathoge­\nnetic molecular mechanisms. In the present study, the case of a \npatient with gastric cancer who, 2 years after curative surgery \nand chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and tegafur, developed \nrecurrent metastatic bilateral Krukenberg tumors with distant \nmetastasis in the ovaries. During treatment, a total hysterec­\ntomy and bilateral salpingo‑oophorectomy were performed, \nand intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin \n(70 mg) was administered. Additionally, ureteroscopy and \nbilateral ureteral stent placement were conducted transure­\nthrally. Post‑surgery, assessments of the genomic alterations \nand microsatellite instability of the tumor revealed an AT‑rich \ninteraction domain 1A (ARID1A) exon c.4720delC mutation \nand a KRAS exon c.35G>C mutation. The potential pathogenic \nmechanisms and clinical significance of these mutations were \nthen further discussed. Mutations in the ARID1A gene could \nincrease the sensitivity of the patient to immune checkpoint \ninhibitor therapy. Additionally, the successful application \nof KRASG12C inhibitors in other cancer types offers a new \napproach for the targeted therapy of Krukenberg tumors. \nTherefore, the present study provides further evidence \nregarding the genomics of Krukenberg tumors, which may aid \nin the development of targeted treatment strategies.\nIntroduction\nGlobally, ovarian cancer is a primary cause of cancer‑related \ndeath among women with malignant tumors of the reproduc­\ntive system (1). Krukenberg tumors, a specialized form of \nmetastatic ovarian cancer, are histologically defined by the \npresence of mucin‑filled signet ring cells (2). Predominantly, \nthese tumors originate from the stomach (76%), with the \ncolorectum being the next most common primary site (11%), \nclassifying them as rare and highly malignant metastatic \nneoplasms with a poor patient prognosis (2‑4). The rarity of \nKrukenberg tumors, coupled with the typically short survival \ntime of those affected, results in a lack of consensus regarding \ntheir diagnosis and treatment (3,5). Furthermore, the absence \nof comprehensive genomic data impedes research into the \nunderlying molecular mechanisms of this disease (6). These \nfactors constrain the comprehension of this rare disease and \nimpede the advancement of targeted treatment strategies.\nThe present study focused on two critical oncogenes: \nAT‑rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) and KRAS. The \nKRAS gene is commonly mutated in multiple types of cancer, \nincluding pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung \nadenocarcinoma (7‑9). KRAS encodes a protein that is a key \ncomponent of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (10), which \nserves a notable role in cell proliferation, differentiation and \nsurvival (11). Mutations in KRAS typically lead to the consti­\ntutive activation of this pathway, promoting the continuous \nproliferation of tumor cells, and are associated with tumor \naggressiveness and therapeutic resistance (12). The ARID1A \ngene is an N‑terminal acetyltransferase (13), and its function is \nclosely related to the occurrence, progression and metastasis of \nvarious types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, endometrial \ncancer and gastric cancer (GC) (14‑17). ARID1A regulates the \nactivity of cyclin proteins by inactivating β‑catenin, thereby \naffecting the progression of the cell cycle (18). Moreover, muta­\ntions in ARID1A are also associated with alterations in the tumor \nimmune microenvironment, potentially enhancing the sensi­\ntivity of tumors to immunotherapy by affecting the stimulator \nof interferon (IFN) genes (STING)/IFN signaling pathway and \npromoting a robust antitumor T‑cell response (14,19,20).\nThe present report describes the case a patient who under­\nwent adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and tegafur \nPostoperative metastatic Krukenberg tumors with ARID1A \nand KRAS mutations in a patient with gastric cancer \ntreated with oxaliplatin and tegafur: A case report\nJIE WU1,  SUZHEN JIANG1,  QINGLING SHEN1  and  HONGXIA GONG2\n1Department of Gynecology, Dongguan Songshan Lake Tungwah Hospital, Dongguan, Guangdong 523000, P.R.

The present study aims \nto provide further genomics research into Krukenberg tumors, \nbut also to provide novel insights into understanding the patho­\ngenesis of Krukenberg tumors and exploring personalized \ntreatment strategies.\nCase report\nIn September 2023, a 46‑year‑old female patient was admitted \nto the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dongguan \nSongshan Lake Tungwah Hospital (Dongguan, China), \npresenting with abdominal distension and difficulty urinating. \nThe patient had experienced progressively worsening abdom­\ninal distension within 2 months and had lost 3 kg in weight \nwithin the 2 weeks prior to admission. The patient had under­\ngone curative surgery for GC in July 2021, with the pathological \nresults indicating poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the \nstomach, with some areas presenting characteristic signet ring \ncells. Postoperatively, the patient received chemotherapy with \noxaliplatin (150 mg, intravenous) and tegafur (160 mg, oral) \nfor eight cycles. The patient denied experiencing any abnormal \nvaginal bleeding. On physical examination in September 2023, \na 10‑cm diameter ovarian mass was palpated behind and to \nthe right of the uterus, which was hard in texture, poorly \nmobile and non‑tender. The laboratory tests revealed CA199 \nat 96.0 U/ml (normal range 0‑30 U/ml), CEA at 1.66 ng/ml \n(normal range 0‑5 ng/ml), CA125 at 33.4 U/ml (normal range \n0‑47 U/ml), human epididymis protein 4 at 420.6 pmol/l \n(normal range 0‑76.2 pmol/l) and AFP at 2.6 IU/ml (normal \nrange 0‑7 IU/ml). Both CA199 and human epididymis protein \n4 were above the normal levels; hemoglobin was 54 g/l (normal \nrange 115‑155 g/l) and creatinine was 135.2 µmol/l (normal \nrange 44‑97 µmol/l).\nAn abdominal color Doppler ultrasound indi­\ncated a hypoechoic mass behind the uterus, measuring \n~110x67x47 mm, with imaging revealing abundant blood flow \nsignals within the mass (Fig. 1A and B). Enhanced abdominal \ncomputed tomography (CT) clearly depicted the tumor vascu­\nlature and necrotic lesions. An irregular cystic‑solid mass was \nobserved in the pelvic cavity, which began to enhance earlier \nthan the uterine wall after the injection of contrast medium \nIoversol, showing heterogeneous hyperenhancement. A large \nvessel could be observed entering the mass from one side, \nand heterogeneous enhancement areas within the mass were \nnoted, which are indicative of tumor necrosis or liquefaction, \nsigns suggestive of a malignant tumor (Fig. 1C‑F). Due to \nthe accompanying symptoms of difficulty urinating, further \nexamination with CT urography and three‑dimensional recon­\nstruction revealed an irregular mass in the pelvic cavity, with \ncompression and narrowing of the lower segments of both \nureters, leading to dilatation of the upper ureteral segments \nand bilateral hydronephrosis. There was a notable delay in \nthe excretion of the right urinary system, with local suspected \nobstruction, surrounding exudate and possible tumor invasion \nrequiring further investigation (Fig. 1G and H).\nThe patient was informed that the treatment options \nincluded chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgery. The \nfollowing treatment plan was determined based on the prefer­\nence of the patient: Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral \nsalpingo‑oophorectomy, pelvic adhesiolysis, transurethral \nbilateral ureteroscopy and bilateral ureteral stent placement. \nThe patient initially underwent a challenging surgical proce­\ndure with thorough exploration of the pelvic and abdominal \ncavities, the observations included: ~100  ml mucinous \nascites in the pelvic and abdominal cavities, as well as two \nsolid masses behind the uterus, originating from the ovaries, \nmeasuring ~70x50x40 mm on the left and 50x40x30 mm on \nthe right. The surfaces of the masses were smooth with intact \ncapsules, exhibiting a reniform shape. The rest of the abdomen \nand organ surfaces were smooth with no obvious lesions. The \nbilateral adnexa and masses were resected (Fig. 2A‑C). Frozen \nsection diagnosis revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma of \nthe ovaries on both sides, with some cancer cells exhibiting \nsignet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), consistent with meta­\nstatic GC. Consequently, an additional total hysterectomy \nwas performed and transurethral ureteroscopy plus bilateral \nureteral stent placement was conducted intraoperatively. The \nsurgical exploration revealed pale mucosa of the bilateral \nureters, with the middle and upper segments becoming narrow \nand rigid due to compression, and no obvious tumor invasion \nwas seen on the ureteral wall. At the end of the surgery, a \nsingle intraperitoneal chemotherapy dose of cisplatin was \nadministered (70 mg in 1,000 ml distilled water).\nPostoperatively, further pathological histological exami­\nnation was conducted. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% \nneutral‑buffered formalin at room temperature for 24 h and \nembedded in paraffin. Sections 4‑µm thick were prepared \nand stained with hematoxylin for 5 min and eosin for 2 min \nat room temperature (Fig. 3A‑C). The stained sections were \nexamined under a light microscope to identify infiltrating \ntumor cells in the stroma. Mucin‑laden signet ring cells \nwith eccentric hyperchromatic nuclei were observed. These \ncells were morphologically compatible with the cells of the \npreviously resected gastric adenocarcinoma tissue. \nFor immunohistochemical analysis, formalin‑fixed, \nparaffin‑embedded tissue sections (4 µm) were used. Antigen \nretrieval was performed by heating at 95˚C in citrate buffer \n(pH 6.0) for 20 min, followed by washing with xylene and \nrehydration through a graded ethanol series. Endogenous \nperoxidase activity was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide \nfor 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated \nwith primary antibodies at 4˚C overnight, followed by incuba­\ntion with HRP‑conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at \nroom temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected using DAB \nchromogen, and counterstaining was performed with hema­\ntoxylin. The slides were examined under a light microscope. \nIn the immunohistochemical diagnosis, the following markers \nwere positive: Cytokeratin (CK)7, mutL homolog (MLH)1, \nMLH2, PMS1 homolog 2 and mutS homolog 6, whereas p53 \nwas wild‑type and there was no amplification of paired box 8 \n(PAX8), SATB homeobox 2 (SATB2) or HER‑2 (Fig. 3D‑L). \nBased on the pathological results, it was confirmed that the \novarian masses were metastatic carcinoma from the previously \ntreated GC, and the mucin‑laden signet ring cells confirmed \nthe diagnosis of Krukenberg tumors.\nIn September 2023, to identify personalized treatment \nstrategies, whole exome sequencing was performed on ovarian \ntumor tissue by Letu Biotechnology Co., Ltd. DNA was extracted \nusing the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Library \npreparation was conducted using the Agilent SureSelect XT \nONCOLOGY LETTERS  29:  262,  2025\n3\nHuman All Exon V8 Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) following \nthe manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed on \nan Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using a paired‑end 150 bp \nstrategy. The final library was loaded at a concentration of \n10 nM, measured using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher \nScientific, Inc.). Genomic DNA was extracted using the FFPE \nTissue Genomic DNA One‑Step Extraction Kit (Hangzhou \nSimgen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and the QIAamp Circulating \nNucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The xGen Lockdown Probe \n(Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), customized with the \nKAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems; Roche Diagnostics), \nwas used for capture reactions, which were conducted with \nDynabeads M‑270 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and the \nxGen Lockdown Hybridization and Wash Kit (Integrated DNA \nTechnologies, Inc.). The libraries were amplified with Illumina \np5 and p7 primers using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix \n(Kapa Biosystems; Roche Diagnostics), and the library \nfragment sizes were determined using the KAPA Library \nQuantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems; Roche Diagnostics) \nand a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). \nTarget‑enriched libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq4000 \nNGS platform (Illumina, Inc.). Data analysis included quality \ncontrol with Trimmomatic (version 0.39; http://github.\ncom/usadellab/Trimmomatic), alignment with BWA (version \n0.7.17; http://github.com/lh3/bwa), PCR duplicate removal \nwith Picard (version 2.23.8; http://github.com/broadinstitute/\npicard) and variant calling with Mutect2 [version 1.1.7 (legacy) \nor part of the GATK 4.x series (current); https://gatk.broad­\ninstitute.org/hc/en‑us/articles/360037593851‑Mutect2] and \nScalpel (version 0.5.3; http://github.com/sleuthkit/scalpel). \nAnnotations were performed with vcf2maf (version 1.6.19; \nhttp://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf). The sequencing depth for \nthe tumor tissue control sample was 1,500x.\nThe DNA sequencing results revealed two genetic muta­\ntions (Table I). The ARID1A gene harbored a frameshift \nmutation (c.4720delC), where a cytosine was deleted at the \n4,720th position of the DNA sequence, resulting in the change \nof proline to histidine at the 1,575th amino acid position of \nthe corresponding protein sequence. Additionally, a missense \nmutation (c.35G>C) was detected in the KRAS gene, with a \nguanine being replaced by a cytosine at the 35th position of the \nDNA sequence, leading to the change of the 12th amino acid \nfrom glycine to alanine in the protein sequence. No abnormali­\nties in terms of gene fusions or copy number variations were \nobserved, and no mutations were found in genes related to the \nhomologous recombinational repair pathway. Microsatellite \ninstability (MSI) indicated a stable microsatellite phenotype.\nPostoperatively, the creatinine level of the patient decreased \nfrom 135.2 µmol/l (normal range 44‑97 µmol/l) preoperatively \nto 66.0 µmol/l on day 4 after surgery, indicating the restoration \nof normal kidney function. Given the stage IV (International \nFederation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 2021) (21) poorly \ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma, adjuvant systemic chemo­\ntherapy was recommended. However, the patient, considering \ntheir predicted survival rate and financial capacity, chose to \ndecline chemotherapy. Finally, the patient succumbed to the \ndisease in January 2024. The overall survival (OS) time, from \nthe initial diagnosis of GC in July 2021 to the time of death, \nFigure 1. Ultrasound, CT, CTU and three‑dimensional reconstruction \nimaging findings.

Specifically, the survival period following \nrecurrence with distant metastatic Krukenberg tumors, \nidentified in September 2023, was 4 months.\nDiscussion\nOvarian metastatic tumors result from the spread of a primary \ncancer from another site to the ovaries (22), accounting for \n10‑25% of all ovarian malignancies (23). Krukenberg tumors, \nas a rare and distinct type of malignant tumor, represent only \n1‑2% of these metastatic tumors (23,24). Krukenberg tumors \nare diagnosed at a markedly younger age compared with \nepithelial ovarian cancer, predominantly affecting premeno­\npausal women with an average age of diagnosis of 45 years (3). \nA previous retrospective analysis of Krukenberg tumors \nrevealed that the median age at diagnosis for these patients was \n48 years, with ages ranging between 22 and 71 years (25). The \npatient reported in the present study was diagnosed at 46 years \nold, which is in accordance with the age distribution cited in \nthe literature. Unlike tumors with overt mucin‑laden signet \nring cells in the pathological histology, the clinical presenta­\ntion of this type of lesion is often more subtle, manifesting as \nan abdominal mass with abdominal distension and insidious \nabdominal pain. Due to its covert onset and lack of distinc­\ntive clinical features, when ascites is present, the disease is \ntypically at an advanced stage (23,26). In the present case, \nthe clinical symptoms were limited to a 2‑month history of \nabdominal distension, and physical examination revealed only \npelvic masses and dullness to percussion, indicative of ascites.\nPreoperative imaging reports also provide a certain reference \nfor the diagnosis of ovarian metastatic tumors. In the present \ncase report, imaging examinations confirmed no notable lesions \nin other areas besides the adnexal region. Ultrasound indicated \na mass behind the uterus with abundant blood flow signals, and \nenhanced CT suggested that the mass was a complex cystic‑solid \nlesion with irregular shape and heterogeneous enhancement. \nFigure 3.

Elevated CA199 levels are often seen in muci­\nnous ovarian cancer, borderline tumors and gastrointestinal \nmetastatic ovarian cancer (29‑32), whereas increased CEA \nlevels are common in gastrointestinal metastatic ovarian \ncancer (33‑36). In the present case, the elevation of CA199 \nsupported the diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer, while \nCEA did not show a significant increase. However, these tumor \nmarker tests aid in diagnosis but lack specificity. A defini­\ntive diagnosis of ovarian metastatic tumors is more reliant \non pathological and immunohistochemical examinations. \nNegative expression of PAX8 can clearly rule out a primary \ntumor and support a metastatic origin (37), CK7 and CK20 are \nimportant markers for distinguishing ovarian tumors (2), and \nSATB2 is typically highly expressed in the lower epithelial \ntissues of the gastrointestinal tract (38). In the present case, \nSATB2 exhibited negative expression.\nAt present, there is a lack of standards or consensus on the \ntreatment of metastatic ovarian cancer due to an insufficient \nnumber of case studies (3,5). While appropriate surgical inter­\nvention can prolong the survival time of patients with primary \ntumors, it is less effective for those with metastatic tumors \nrequiring combined treatment with radiotherapy or chemo­\ntherapy, with recurrence often occurring within 2‑5 years (39). \nIn the present case, NGS was utilized for genomic analysis \nof the tumor tissue, revealing mutations at c.4720delC in the \nARID1A gene and c.35G>C in the KRAS gene, with the aim of \nidentifying potential targeted therapies.\nARID1A, also known as NAA10 (40), is recognized as a \ntumor suppressor gene that is integral to the SWI/SNF chro­\nmatin remodeling complex (41). ARD1A has been identified as \none of the frequently mutated chromatin remodeling genes in \nGC (42). Mutations in ARD1A across the entire coding region \nare prevalent in GC, typically resulting in inactivating muta­\ntions, including truncating mutations and insertions/deletions \nthat lead to frameshifts (43,44), which have a pivotal role in \nthe initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer, as well as \ncell cycle arrest (14,18). In terms of pathogenesis, mutations in \nARID1A can inactivate β‑catenin, subsequently reducing the \ntranscription of cyclin D1, leading to cell cycle arrest at the \nG0/G1 phase (18). Although cell cycle arrest is generally consid­\nered an anticancer mechanism, certain studies have proposed \nthe concept of the DNA damage model, where cell cycle arrest \ncan, in some cases, drive cells into senescence, increasing the \nrisk of genetic mutations and thereby promoting cancer devel­\nopment (45‑47). This suggests that cell cycle arrest induced \nby ARID1A mutations can exert stress on cells, leading to the \naccumulation of DNA damage and further genetic mutations, \nthus promoting cancer development.\nPrevious studies have underscored the importance of \nARID1A mutations in a spectrum of cancer types, including \nGC and CRC (14‑17); however, their role in metastatic ovarian \ncancer, such as in Krukenberg tumors, remains inadequately \nexplored. In murine models, ARD1A has been demonstrated \nto stabilize nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 through \ndirect interaction, thereby promoting the progression of \nCRC (48). Furthermore, research has established an association \nbetween ARID1A mutations and OS in patients with GC. In a \ncohort of 518 patients with GC, immunohistochemical assess­\nments revealed that, compared with those without ARID1A \nmutations, patients with ARID1A‑mutated GC were older, \nexhibited higher tumor MSI and had a greater prevalence of \nPI3K/AKT pathway mutations. Multivariate analysis indicated \nthat ARID1A mutations were an independent prognostic factor \nfor diffuse‑type GC (49). These findings align with the present \ncase, suggesting that ARID1A mutations are not isolated events \nand may have a role in the pathogenesis of Krukenberg tumors. \nHowever, large‑scale studies specifically targeting Krukenberg \ntumors are lacking, underscoring the need for further research \nto substantiate these observations.\nIn terms of treatment, certain clinical trials of immune \ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revealed that ARID1A muta­\ntions are significantly enriched in responders to immunotherapy \nacross various solid tumor types, independent of MSI (50‑54). \nPatients with ARID1A‑mutated gastrointestinal tumors have \nbeen shown to exhibit more favorable treatment responses \nto programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1)/programmed \ndeath‑ligand 1 (PD‑L1) therapies and have improved survival \noutcomes compared with those with ARID1A wild‑type \ntumors (55). Preclinical studies using mouse models have \nconfirmed that the loss of ARID1A in tumor cells induces \nR‑loops, and the cellular membrane DNA species produced \nby R‑loops activate the STING/type I IFN signaling pathway, \ninducing an ARID1A‑IFN gene expression signature that \npromotes antitumor immunity  (14,19,20), explaining the \nenhanced responsiveness of ARID1A‑mutated human tumors \nto ICIs. ICI therapy has also demonstrated favorable response \nrates in a multitude of clinical trials involving GC. Interim \nresults from the Phase III MATTERHORN trial have \nTable I.

Similarly, \npreliminary results from the DANTE trial have suggested \nthat the combination of a PD‑1 inhibitor (atezolizumab) with \nchemotherapy is associated with improved safety and efficacy \ncompared with the FLOT regimen alone in patients with \nresectable GEJAC (57). These clinical data on immunotherapy \nfor GC indicate that ICIs, particularly PD‑1 inhibitors, may \nexhibit promising efficacy and safety profiles for patients with \nKrukenberg tumors harboring ARID1A mutations.\nKRAS gene mutations are closely associated with tumor \ndevelopment, and the encoded protein is a key component \nof the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (10,11), which can \ndirectly promote cell metabolism and proliferation, partici­\npate in tumor immune evasion and modulate the immune \nsystem response to tumor cells, thereby affecting the tumor \nmicroenvironment (12). In the present case, DNA sequencing \nrevealed a KRAS mutation corresponding to the amino acid \nchange, p.G12A (glycine at the 12th position), located in a \nkey structural domain of the protein and a known mutation \nhotspot (58,59). Mutations at G12 affect the binding of KRAS \nprotein to the GTP/GDP cycle, leading to continuous activation \nof the KRAS protein, abnormal activation of the MAPK/ERK \nsignaling pathway, uncontrolled cell proliferation and ulti­\nmately contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis (60‑62). \nKRAS mutations are among the most extensively studied \nand are distinctively characterized oncogenic alterations, \noccurring in 17‑25% of all cancers, with a prevalence of ~9% \nin GC and 30‑40% in CRC (63,64). In a cohort analysis of \n595 patients with GC, those with KRAS mutations and an \nMSI status exhibited a longer survival time compared with \npatients without KRAS mutations and a microsatellite stable \nstatus (65). Furthermore, KRAS harboring the G12 mutation \nis associated with poorer patient survival in GC (66,67). \nWarneke et al (67) evaluated the prognostic significance of \ndifferent phenotypic and genotypic markers, including KRAS, \nPIK3CA and MSI, in GC and predicted the feasibility of \napplying these markers in personalized therapy for GC. The \nresults indicated that patients with proximal GC harboring \nKRAS mutations had shorter survival times than those without \nmutations (3.5 vs. 12.7 months). Additionally, in a study of \nSRCC of the stomach, immunohistochemistry revealed posi­\ntive KRAS expression in the majority of SRCC samples, which \nwas higher than in the intestinal‑type cohort (28 vs. 12.6%). \nConcurrently, patients with KRAS mutations had a median OS \ntime of 12.5 months, compared with 19.5 months for those \nwithout KRAS mutations, demonstrating a notable reduction \nin OS (66).\nIn the therapeutic domain, studies have confirmed that \nKRASG12C inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, have \nshown clinical activity in clinical trials for KRASG12C‑mutated \nnon‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and CRC (60,61,68,69). \nSpecifically, in patients with NSCLC, a confirmed response \nrate of 53.4% was observed, with a median progression‑free \nsurvival (PFS) time of 13.1  months. In CRC, 29.1% of \npatients exhibited a response, with a PFS time of 5.6 months. \nAlthough treatment‑related adverse events occurred in 93% \nof patients, the most common being nausea (74%), diarrhea \n(61%) and vomiting (58%), the majority were grade 1‑2 (94%) \nand resolved following symptomatic management and drug \ndiscontinuation (68). Overall, based on the current clinical \ndata, KRASG12C inhibitors demonstrate a favorable safety \nprofile in other malignancies, providing preliminary support \nfor their potential application in Krukenberg tumors.\nWhile the present study underscores potential therapeutic \nstrategies based on ARID1A mutations and KRASG12C inhibi­\ntors, their clinical application in Krukenberg tumors remains \nspeculative. The rarity of this disease contributes to a scar­\ncity of therapeutic references and research. Considering the \nunique tumor microenvironment and immune characteristics \nof Krukenberg tumors, larger cohort studies are necessary to \nfurther evaluate the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in \nthis tumor type.\nIn conclusion, the present study describes the case of a patient \nwith Krukenberg tumors harboring two mutated genes, and \ndiscusses the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance \nof tumor invasion caused by ARID1A and KRAS mutations. The \nmutation in the ARID1A gene may increase sensitivity to ICI \ntherapy, whereas the successful application of KRASG12C inhibi­\ntors in other cancer types provides novel insights for targeted \ntherapy of Krukenberg tumors. The patient in the present case \nachieved an OS time of 30 months from the initial diagnosis of \nGC, but only 4 months following the recurrence of Krukenberg \ntumors. This highlights the poor prognosis of this disease and \nthe urgent need for the development of effective therapeutic \nstrategies. Nevertheless, as the first study, to the best of our \nknowledge, to explore the genomic alterations of Krukenberg \ntumors, it offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms \nof this rare disease. These preliminary findings may stimulate \nfurther research to validate the efficacy of these molecular \ntargets, ultimately improving patient treatment outcomes.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Feng Na (Department of \nPathology, Dongguan Songshan Lake Hospital, Dongguan, \nChina) for the assistance and expertise contributed to the \npresent study.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Dongguan \nSocial Development and Technology Program (grant \nno. 20211800901802).\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe datasets generated in the present study may be found in \nthe NCBI database under accession number PRJNA1240087 \nor at the following URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nsra/?term=PRJNA1240087.\nAuthors' contributions\nJW was responsible for the conception and design of the study, \nand drafted the manuscript.

    "summary": "논문 \"ONCOLOGY LETTERS 29: 262, 2025\"에서는 Krukenberg 종양에 대해 다루고 있습니다. Krukenberg 종양은 흔하지 않은 전이성 난소암으로 주로 위에서 기원합니다. 이 연구에서는 위암 환자가 수술 및 화학요법 후 2년 만에 난소에 재발성 전이성 Krukenberg 종양이 발생한 사례를 소개하고 있습니다. 연구팀은 종양의 유전적 변이와 미세위성 불안정성을 평가하였고, ARID1A 유전자와 KRAS 유전자의 변이가 발견되었습니다. 이러한 변이는 면역 체크포인트 억제제 치료에 대한 환자의 민감성을 증가시킬 수 있으며, KRASG12C 억제제의 성공적인 적용이 Krukenberg 종양의 표적 치료 전략 개발에 도움이 될 수 있음을 시사합니다. 이 연구는 Krukenberg 종양의 유전체에 대한 이해를 높이고 표적 치료 전략을 개발하는 데 기여할 수 있습니다.",
