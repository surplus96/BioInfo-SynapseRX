\subsection{Detailed Description}
\#\# ----- GENERAL INFORMATION \#\# \#\# FILE \hyperlink{memhandler_8h_source}{memhandler.h} \#\# AUTHORS P. Schmidtke and V. Le Guilloux \#\# LAST MODIFIED 28-11-08 \#\# \#\# ----- SPECIFICATIONS \#\# \#\# This file implements a memory handler. Whenever you call \#\# my\_\-bloc\_\-malloc function, the allocated pointer will be \#\# stored in a simple chained list. Then, if a malloc fails, \#\# or if you call the my\_\-exit function, all allocated variable \#\# will be freed if not NULL of course. Therefore, a bloc \#\# allocated by my\_\-... functions MUST be freed by the my\_\-free, \#\# or a double free error should appears. \#\# \#\# WARNING \#\# \#\# This is an easy way to handle memory. However, if many bloc \#\# are allocated and removed during the programm, it might be \#\# solwed down as for each free, as we have to look for the bloc \#\# to free in the list, and remove it. \#\# \#\# REMEMBER: if you use my\_\-malloc, you MUST use my\_\-free. If you \#\# free a bloc allocated by my\_\-(..), and if you call free\_\-all at \#\# the end, a double free coprruption will occure. \#\# \#\# ----- MODIFICATIONS HISTORY \#\# \#\# 28-11-08 (v) Comments UTD \#\# 01-04-08 (v) Added comments and creation of history \#\# 01-01-08 (vp) Created (random date...) \#\# \#\# ----- TODO or SUGGESTIONS \#\# COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER
